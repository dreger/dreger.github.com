title: Times to code
---

Coding takes a lot of focus. Distractions like email, Twitter and your environment can detract from your productivity at the keyboard. To help remedy this, I usually do most of my work either late at night, or early in the morning.

At night, the day has wound down and you’re not going to be distracted by any upcoming appointments for the day. This is one of the times where I’m most productive. However, it is important to remember if you choose this route, to supplement your sleep with a nap the following afternoon.

Writing code in the morning can be a beautiful thing, as long as you get up early enough to make it work. A good time to shoot for is around 6am. If you can make that time, the world around you is still asleep, no one has done anything interesting online yet and the time crunch to finish before your first class is a great motivator.

Both options have different pros and cons and I recommend trying both out to see which works best for you. You can also do what I do, which is flip-flop between the two depending on your schedule the next day. Regardless, try out writing code during these times and see if it helps you get more done.
