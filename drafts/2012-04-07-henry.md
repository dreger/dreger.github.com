Today, we got to go see the Columbus Crew play the New York Red Bulls in Crew Stadium. This was exciting for quite a few reasons, mainly being that it was a road trip iwth my cousins, brother, uncle and father, but also because we would be getting to see Thierry Henry play in person for the first time. 

I still remember the first time I ever saw Henry play on telivision. I don't rememb erht agme, and I don't remember the date, but I remember that he had jsut gotten a free kick just outside the box. He eyeed it up for a couple seconds before smashing it in with a beautiful curve. He was playing for Arsenal, the team my brother would quickly end up supporting for life,
