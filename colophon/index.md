## Colophon
My name is Kyle Dreger and welcome to my website. Although it changes from time to time, this website primarily serves as an outlet for my  writing endeavors.

### History
Founded in the fall of 2010 when [I began attending]({% post_url 2010-08-27-hello-college %}) the University of Mount Union, I've written here on a diverse subset of topics. Inspiration comes from [my faith](http://bible.us/116/psa.1.3.nlt) and a love for building beautiful software. Offline, I play soccer and am dating the most incredible girl.

### Setup
Now the fun bits and bytes: [GitHub](http://github.com/kyledreger) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) generate and host the source of this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them), and any beautiful webfonts are courtesy of [Typekit](http://typekit.com).

I currently enjoy writing posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com). Composing takes place on either a 13' Macbook Pro, or an iPhone 4.

### Contact
If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to [say hello](mailto:hi@kyledreger.com?subject=hello!) or mention @kyledreger on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dreger) / (more frequently) [App.net](http://alpha.app.net/kyledreger).
