Kyle Dreger is a writer and designer. This website serves as an outlet for his creative writing endeavors. Unfortunately, he's not very good at writing in the third person, so I'm going to stop before harm befalls any innocent pronouns.

Originally at [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com), I started this site in the fall of 2010 when I began attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu). I enjoy writing, and do so here on various topics. I believe in God ([#teamJesus](http://bible.us/116/psa.1.3.nlt)), love technology and building cool things with it, play soccer, and have the most beautiful girlfriend in the world - no contest.

If you'd like to get in touch, shoot an email to <hi@kyledreger.com> or mention @dreger on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dreger) / (more frequently) [App.net](http://alpha.app.net/dreger).

### SETUP

Now the fun bits and bytes. Currently, [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) generate and host the source of this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them). Any beautiful webfonts are courtesy of [Typekit](http://typekit.com).

I currently enjoy writing posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com). Composing takes place on either a 13' Macbook Pro, or an iPhone 4.
