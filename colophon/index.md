## This guy.
<br>
Kyle Dreger, nice to meet you. Welcome to my website where I enjoy writing and experimenting with web design. Thanks for visiting.

### Circa 2010
I started writing here when [I began attending]({% post_url 2010-08-27-hello-college %}) the University of Mount Union. Inspiration comes from [my faith](http://bible.us/116/psa.1.3.nlt) and a love for building beautiful software. Offline, I play soccer, code and am <s>dating</s> engaged to the most incredible woman.

### Pass the code
[GitHub](http://github.com/kyledreger) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) host and generate this site respectfully. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), webfonts (if any) are courtesy of [Typekit](http://typekit.com), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format via [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com) or [iA Writer](http:iawriter.com).

### G'day, governor
If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to [say hello by email](mailto:hi@kyledreger.com?subject=hello!) or mention me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kyledreger) and [App.net](http://alpha.app.net/kyledreger).
