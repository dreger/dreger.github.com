<p><strong>Hello</strong>, my name is Kyle Dreger. For the past nine years, I've had a love for user experience, typography, and clean, functional design.</p>

<p>I am currently in my senior year at the University of Mount Union, double majoring in computer science and writing. I work at the Center for Writing and Oral Communication where I teach students effective ways to write and speak.</p>

<p>For the past two summers, I've interned at The Timken Company in the New Technology department. At Timken, I helped usher in a new web framework for rapid web application development and lead the design for multiple iPad web applications.</p>

<p>Here is some of my web and design work:</p>

<h2 class="section-title">On Tap Grille and Bar</h2>
<span class="description">
<p>When owner Mike Simms asked me to help him develop a website for his restaurant, I was excited to try my hand at a single-page design. Drawing inspiration from minimalist menus, strong typography, and backing it all up with a functional CMS system, On Tap Grille and Bar website works great on all devices. </p>

<li>Responsive design</li>
<li>HTML5, CSS3 (SASS)</li>
<li>Photoshop and Illustrator CS5</li>
<li>Perch CMS installation and setup</li>

<h2 class="section-title">kyledreger.com, a web column</h2>
<span class="description">
<p>For a senior project in my writing major, I proposed writing my own web column on technology, design, and Apple. Before I started writing articles, I created a design that <em>feels</em> like a newspaper column, while embracing the dyanamic and interactive nature of the web. It&#8217;s lightning fast, simple, and honest.</p>

<li>HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), JavaScript</li>
<li>Amazon S3 for web hosting</li>
<li>Static site generation via <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll.rb</a></li>
