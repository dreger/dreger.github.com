I'm the director of product at Patriot Software where I help empower our product and design teams. We're building some of the fastest, simplest, and most affordable online software for small businesses—so if that sounds like fun, [come join us](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/about/careers/).

This site is run out of my own pocket and in my spare time. What it lacks in regularity is hopefully made up for in quality.

I aim to write so you don’t need to skim. Rigorous editing is a cornerstone of this website, and I keep an in-house style guide, which you’re welcome to read and remix. (On the other hand, we have a new baby in the house so my editing will only be as good as I can make it at midnight.) I also believe that clarity of writing follows clarity of thought, which only comes after you’ve written multiple terrible first drafts.

Some random tidbits I enjoy sharing: energy, diction, and honesty are three great words; have strong opinions, loosely held; waffles are the bar by which all other breakfast foods are judged; and if you want to be a better writer, read everything you can.
