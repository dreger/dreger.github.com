I remember when Angry Birds was first released for the iPhone. I easilly sunk hours, and hours of my life into collecting every star, and popping every piggie. 

Now, Rovio has released a new game called Bad Piggies. I had always thought about a game from the perspective of the pigs, but Rovio went ahead and built them a completely different type of gameplay.
