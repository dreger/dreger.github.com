There are typically two types of photographs. The ones where the subjects are staged and ready for the shot, and the other where they are caught in the middle of another activity. I love the latter.

Photographs, to me, represent a snapshot of our personalities. I have nothing against staged photographs, where would family portraits be without them, but I prefer to see photos of people *doing* things. Riding a bike, about to kiss, or caught mid laughing. These are the photos that best represent the subject and their personality.
