The trend towards big and beautiful online article design is becoming more common. This past year, the _New York Times_ [went through a large redesign](http://www.nytimes.com/redesign/), focusing on bigger type and giving every article a command of the page. Just this last month, Time.com [did the same](http://time.com/13113/time-coms-redesign/), rolling out a new, bigger layout &mdash; following the same large-article trend as the _Times_. 

Although these new layouts bode well for readability, Felix Salmon, writing for _Rueters_, argues that the change in design [removes important visual cues](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/27/against-beautiful-journalism/) that determine whether an article is important or not: 

> More to the point, news websites have always struggled with any one-size-fits-all approach to stories. A format which works for a 6,000-word feature is not going to work well for a 150-word brief. Web designers have known this for years, but still news sites tend to put all of their stories into exactly the same template — and increasingly that template is designed for ambitious longform storytelling. Which, of course, generally accounts for only a tiny fraction of the material on the site.

He goes on, explaining that the new design pulls a bait-and-switch on the reader, ruining expectations:  

> The result is a cognitive disconnect: why is the website design telling me that this short blog post is incredibly important, when in reality it’s just a blockquote and a single line of snark? [...] It’s time for websites to put a lot more effort into de-emphasizing less important stories, reserving the grand presentation formats only for the pieces which deserve it. 

All valid points, but I think Salmon misses the mark. 

I would argue that the readers of today don't notice, or care all that much, that all of the _Times's_ articles have the same layout. For a generation that has grown up getting their news on the internet, a literal smorgasbord of different layouts and designs, bigger text and full-width images doesn't always imply importance. Where Salmon calls for the web designs to "bring back a little bit of noise and clutter" for the sake of visual hierarchy, I would rather do without. 

<aside>Most of my peers don't _browse_ the front page of a website anymore. If they are reading an article from the _Times_, it was most likely passed through one of their social circles and recommended by a friend.</aside>

The new designs used by the _New York Times_ and _Time_ may not cater to those readers who relied on visual cues to curb their reading. However, the new layouts, from what I can gather, are a strong attempt to make reading experience a priority, regardless of what piece you may be viewing. 

In an world where your readers will be using hundreds of different devices to read your content, ensuring _everything_ looks good _everywhere_ is worth the annoyance of change.
