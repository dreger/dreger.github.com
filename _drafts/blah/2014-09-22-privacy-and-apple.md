Apple:

> We publish all request data permitted by law, but we believe our customers deserve to know more about what their governments and law enforcement agencies are requesting. We are actively engaged with the White House, as well as policymakers and government regulators around the world, to allow for more accurate and complete disclosures and reforms to overreaching surveillance laws and practices.

If you use Apple devices, I encourage you to skim through this page; it's a good idea to understand how your data is being handled.
