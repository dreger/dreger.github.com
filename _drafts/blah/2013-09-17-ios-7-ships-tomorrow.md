Just a reminder to all my friends and readers that iOS 7 is  [rolling out tomorrow](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715240/ios-7-release-date) for all devices. Although I don't know exactly what time it will be available, pushing out any software to nearly 700,000,000 devices is no small task - be patient.

In terms of what to expect, iOS 7 is a large departure from what we're familiar with. However, the new design and underlying philosophy are _still_ founded on consistency and reliability. Give it a week and you'll find yourself subtly delighted with the details.

_Two good resources to get caught up quickly on what's new in iOS 7 and the overall ideology are [Apple's own page](http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/) and [John Gruber's thoughts](http://daringfireball.net/2013/06/ios_7_signature) after the unveiling at WWDC._

iOS 7 is the first step in a brand new direction for Apple, and there will undoubtedly be some issues along the way. However, given the positive feedback I've seen on Twitter from several developers using iOS 7 full-time, I think it's finally ready for the masses. Apple certainly does.
