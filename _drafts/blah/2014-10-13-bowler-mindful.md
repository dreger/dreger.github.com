Chris Bowler: 

> When we buy stuff, the end result is we have to take care of it. Store it. Clean it. Back it up. The more stuff we have, the more work is involved and the more stressed we can become because of it. This fact is magnified when the stuff we buy is junk.

Exactly. All stuff has a cost, beyond that of its price tag. Invest in quality gear, and it will save you pain in the long run.
