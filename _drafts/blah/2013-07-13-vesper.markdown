I've tried tens of iOS note-taking applications over the years. Among others, I've tested Simplenote, Elements, iA Writer, and Notesy, but none were able to evoke the feelings I get when writing something into my [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com) notebook. I was looking for _delight_.

Then I found [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co).

Vesper is a different kind of note-taking application under the mantra "Collect your thoughts," and developed by three gentlemen all seasoned in apps and design. Named after a [cocktail invented by James Bond](http://goo.gl/9B5pS), Vesper is every bit as subtle and well dressed as Bond himself. I find myself delighted in the simple animations, speed (like butter on my iPhone 4), and execution of concepts like tagging and archiving.

$4.99 may seem steep for a note-taking app with only a handful of features and no syncing, but go read Dave Wiskus's [post on designing Vesper](http://vesperapp.co/blog/how-to-make-a-vesper/) and you'll see just how much effort was put into nailing the details. That's what I'm happy to pay for.

At half the cost for a 3-pack of Field Notes, I consider Vesper an investment in how my brain enjoys working. My only concern is the lack of syncing / iCloud backup, however I'm certain that's one feature we'll be seeing eventually. If you love Field Notes, skip the grande coffee today and grab a copy of Vesper instead.
