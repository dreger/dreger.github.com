Membership Information

A membership to kyledreger.com is the best way to help support this site and my writing. It is important to note that membership is not required to view any of the content on this site (that stuff will always be free), but I have created some perks for those who do take the plunge:

Price: $2.25 a month

MEMBERHIP PERKS
Newsletter — A handwritten, weekly newsletter that contains some of the best links and commentary that I didn't post to kyledreger.com. My goal for this newsletter is to give my members a relaxed, personal email, filled with links that I think complement a good cup of coffee and a weekend afternoon.

ORDER PROCESSING
My membership system is backed by Stripe, a proven and reliable payment processing service (like PayPal, but way less sketchy). On top of Stripe, I use Plasso to provide a secure and easy way for you to manage subscription and credit card information.
