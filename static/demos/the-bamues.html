<h1>The Bamues</h1>
<small>By <a href="/">Kyle Dreger</a>.</small>
<p>Before we begin,<br>
I nod to the past.<br>
To a Dr&rsquo;s great stories<br>
stories that last.  </p>

<p>And as with &ldquo;new&rdquo; things,<br>
mine&rsquo;s a remix of his.<br>
But I feel he&rsquo;d like it<br>
being written for kids.  </p>

<p>With an inspired rhythm<br>
and my own crafted words.<br>
Let me finally tell<br>
a tale I once heard&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why hello dear Friend<br>
I&rsquo;ve got a story for you.<br>
A tale of priorities<br>
and I promise it&rsquo;s true.  </p>

<p>We start in Bamash<br>
where Bamues choose to live.<br>
And each Bamue couple<br>
had a couple Bamue kids.  </p>

<p>Bamues went to work<br>
and got off around five<br>
They&rsquo;d pick up their families<br>
then go out for a drive.  </p>

<p>They&rsquo;d park in a park<br>
and play games in the sun.<br>
Chasing Bunglebees and Slurps<br>
oh what fun, fun, fun!  </p>

<p>Then, one day, an oPhone<br>
showed up in our stores.<br>
Look at all the oApps!<br>
Could you ever want more?  </p>

<p>Soon all Bamue girls<br>
and all Bamue chaps<br>
were holding an oPhone<br>
and playing with oApps.  </p>

<p>They stared at those screens<br>
as they walked around town.<br>
Ignoring the world<br>
all heads tilted down.  </p>

<p>Now they talked to each other,<br>
just not in the usual way.<br>
They tapped updates to oChirp<br>
and oMessage all day  </p>

<p>But soon parks were empty<br>
the sun sat there alone.<br>
For Bamues were inside<br>
all playing with oPhones.  </p>

<p>In the Fall, a traveler<br>
arrived at Bamash.<br>
A well dressed young man<br>
though he had little cash.  </p>

<p>And this well dressed young chap<br>
strolled straight into town.<br>
But his hands were empty<br>
and his head wasn&rsquo;t down!  </p>

<p>He walked up to a Bamue<br>
&ldquo;Hello, sir&rdquo; he said<br>
&ldquo;Are there hotels around<br>
That I might rest my head?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Bamue man just stared<br>
then said with a huff,<br>
&ldquo;Stop bothering me, kid<br>
there&rsquo;s an oApp for that stuff.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The young chap was surprised<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said.<br>
And the Bamue man walked away<br>
oPhone back to his head.  </p>

<p>Our young chap just stood there,<br>
as Bamues walked around.<br>
Not a word being said<br>
and all eyes towards the ground.  </p>

<p>Confused was our visitor<br>
&ldquo;The sun is outside!<br>
Why don&rsquo;t you get in your cars<br>
And go out for a drive?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But the response was the same<br>
whether Bamue sister or father.<br>
Their minds on their oPhones<br>
and didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered.  </p>

<p>Despair filled the heart<br>
of our well dressed young man,<br>
with no cash in his pockets<br>
and two empty hands.  </p>

<p>He packed up his things,<br>
though they were few,<br>
and headed out of Bamash<br>
leaving the Bamues.  </p>

<p>Outside of the town<br>
he paused to straighten his tie.<br>
When he caught something shiny<br>
from the corner of his eye.  </p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s when he saw it<br>
a tower quite tall.<br>
That powered the oPhones<br>
the oApps, it all!  </p>

<p>The young chap then knew<br>
what had to be done.<br>
He&rsquo;d unplug the tower<br>
and bring back true fun.  </p>

<p>He rushed to the base<br>
of the mighty tall structure.<br>
&ldquo;Now where is the plug,&rdquo;<br>
he silently wondered.  </p>

<p>He searched all around<br>
through bushes and trees.<br>
Finally finding a wire<br>
buried under some leaves  </p>

<p>But try as he might<br>
to yank out that cord,<br>
the ground held firm<br>
and he soon became sore.  </p>

<p>As he lay on his back<br>
a Bamue walked by.<br>
A pretty Bamue girl<br>
with piecing blue eyes  </p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing,&rdquo;<br>
she asked the young man.<br>
And he noticed she too,<br>
had two empty hands.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bamues are Bamboozled,&rdquo;<br>
the young chap sighed<br>
&ldquo;If I unplug this tower<br>
Perhaps they&rsquo;ll see why.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>And he told her the story<br>
of his visit to town.<br>
She stood there, just listening<br>
without smile or frown.  </p>

<p>When he finished explaining<br>
she looked up with a smirk.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in, let&rsquo;s do this<br>
With two there&rsquo;s less work.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So together they stood<br>
and held firm to the plug.<br>
Then pulled as hard<br>
as their arms could tug.  </p>

<p>And with a loud POP!<br>
the wire did snap.<br>
And our two strange friends<br>
ran back to Bamash.  </p>

<p>Back in the town<br>
the Bamues stood confused.<br>
Their oPhones weren&rsquo;t working<br>
no oChirps, no oTunes!  </p>

<p>With screens now off,<br>
they looked up from their shoes.<br>
And each met the gaze<br>
of another Bamue.  </p>

<p>Our two friends arrived back<br>
in the town with a bus.<br>
And each Bamash citizen<br>
Got aboard without fuss.  </p>

<p>They drove to the park.<br>
Then parked in a spot.<br>
And began to remember<br>
that thing they&rsquo;d forgot.  </p>

<p>And every Bamue<br>
broke out into games.<br>
Chasing Bunglebees and Slurps<br>
just like the old days.  </p>

<p>Our two friends found a seat<br>
on a hill in the sun.<br>
Their work here was finished<br>
they&rsquo;d brought back true fun  </p>

<p>And every Bamue<br>
be it mother or son<br>
relearned how to live life<br>
since we only have one.  </p>

<p>So best you take a break<br>
from a phone, or whatever.<br>
Because I promise you real life<br>
is oh, so much better.  </p>
