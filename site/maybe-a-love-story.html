<h2>Maybe a love story</h2>

<p><em>(The following is, if you will, unstructured poetry - I have no idea what it means, even though I wrote it.)</em></p>

<p>There once was a story about love, but that story wasn&#8217;t ever published. It was a story in the sense that it had a beginning and middle, but, notably, it lacked an end. There was a main character, the protagonist, and many obstacles for him, or was it a her, to overcome. No matter how hard they tried, the story just kept going. One adventure would lead to another. Even the rainy, boring days seemed to go on forever.</p>

<p>The protagonist played his, or maybe her, part extrodinarily well. Transversing through the storyline and weaving their own unique metaphors throughout the fabric of the plot. But this was a story about love, which means that there must be someone <em>to</em> love, and someone to <em>be</em> loved. Can love exist with only one? Maybe, but that&#8217;s not how this story went.</p>

<p>So it was, that love requried two.</p>

<p>And they lived happily ever after. Forever.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
