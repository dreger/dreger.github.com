<h2>Text files</h2>

<p>Text files are one of those things that will never go away. They are organic to the computer world and are supported by every operating system. However, many people don&#8217;t take advantage of the awesome powers that text files hold. Here is my quick and simple guide to start implementing a little more text into your lifestyle.</p>

<h3 id='open_up_an_editor'>Open up an editor</h3>

<p>One the Mac? Use TextEdit in plain text mode. On the PC? Use Notepad or similar. It really doesn&#8217;t matter which text editor you end up using (note: Microsoft Word is <em>not</em> a viable option for what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish), what matters is that the application is as minimal as possible so you can focus on the content, not the window chrome.</p>

<h3 id='put_the_date_in_the_file_name'>Put the date in the file name</h3>

<p>Use the scheme YYYY/MM/DD at the beginning or somewhere in your text file name. That way, you&#8217;re only a quick name-sort or query away from finding the file you want.</p>

<h3 id='make_lots'>Make lots</h3>

<p>Have a todo list? Make a todo.txt. Have a draft of a blog post? Keep it in a my-awesome-draft.txt. Don&#8217;t overburden one text file with ALL of your information. Even thought it could handle the job, and some people prefer having one text file to rule them all, I find it is much easier to find and organize into folders my text files if they are separates beings.</p>

<h3 id='have_a_captureall_mentality'>Have a capture-all mentality</h3>

<p>Keep one text file for those quick little blurbs of information you get throughout the day that you need to remember. Whether it be a quote, a movie you see a trailer for you like, or anything, throw it in that text file. You&#8217;ll always be able to go back and delete things you remembered or don&#8217;t feel are important anymore, but you&#8217;ll never be able to add back that one thing you can&#8217;t remember at the end of the day.</p>

<h3 id='do_it'>Do it</h3>

<p>Writing in text files is a weird thing to do if you&#8217;ve never gotten into the practice of it before. Keep at it. Once you get use to having a million of little files all organized by folders, you will achieve a sense of peace and organization that, for me, is unmatched by any other application on your computer.</p>

<p>Love the text files and they will love you.</p>
