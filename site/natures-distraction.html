<h2>Nature's distraction</h2>

<section class="article-content">
<p>My girlfriend and I were recently sitting in the library doing homework when it began to rain outside. The sound of raindrops hitting the roof sounded like a roar of a jet engine right outside the nearby window. A couple of minutes later she asked me if I wanted to see a poem she had written for one of her literature classes. I liked it so much that I asked her for a copy. She graciously agreed and I would like to share it with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Natureâ€™s Distraction</p>

<p>Startling pellets of water shoot at the rooftop<br />First, slow then picking up faster, then louder <br />Until it makes you stop and look out the window.<br />The steady build-up of noise,<br />like the noise of an on-coming train. <br />In the background, music pouring out of headphones, <br />secondary to the rain.<br />My fingers pressing down the keys as I write.<br />Finally these secondary noises become primary <br />To the rooftop echo as nature begins to calm.<br />It is then, I focus on my work,<br />Until the rain starts again.</p>
