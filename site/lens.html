<h2>Lens</h2>

<section class="article-content">
<p>I just made my first camera lens in Adobe Illustrator. Following the awesome <a href='http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustration/create-an-aperture-style-camera-lens-icon/'>tutorial on Tuts+</a>, it took me about two hours to complete. I&#8217;ve got lots of improving to do, but I&#8217;ve always wanted to learn how to make something this intricate and downright cool.</p>

<p>Illustration is a world I&#8217;ve long looked at, but never really set foot in like I did with web design. However, after only two hours working on the camera lens, I realized that I have a strong passion for this type of design. Being able to create <em>anything</em> I can think of makes me feel enlivened.</p>

<p>With enough effort, anyone can learn practically anything with the Internet. Hopefully by the end of this summer, I will be a much better illustrator than I am now, and have learned a new way to create things I enjoy.</p>
