<h2>I lost my iPhone</h2>

<p>Fun little thing that happened to me today:</p>

<p>Was walking in the library when I went to grab my iPhone, but it wasn&#8217;t in my pocket. I checked my bag and laptop case, but it wasn&#8217;t there either. I started to freak out a bit. I didn&#8217;t have a passcode set and thinking of how many websites it was authenticated with made me sweat.</p>

<p>I quickly went to a computer, logged on to iCloud.com and went to Find My iPhone. I saw a little GPS pin drop on the east side of the library and start moving towards the circulation desk. After marveling at this realtime event, I remotely set the passcode and had it show the message &#8220;Please call:&#8221; with my girlfriend&#8217;s cell phone number. Five minutes later the circulation desk calls her. They have my phone and we walk over to pick it up.</p>

<p>Apple rocks.</p>

<p><em>Special thanks to my girlfriend and her calming demeanor towards what, I&#8217;m sure, was a very hysterical 19 year old.</em></p>
