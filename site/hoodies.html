<h2>Hoodies</h2>

<section class="article-content">
<p>I love them. Hooded sweatshirts, or &#8220;hoodies&#8221;, are one of my favorite pieces of clothing. Whenever I get a hoodie, I&#8217;ll wear it until the fabric is begging to be thrown away. I love the simple colors and pulling the sleeves up when you sit down to type. I enjoy trying to make the drawstring perfectly symmetrical. Eventually, however, I almost always end up pulling that string out.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re versatile, able to be worn through the winter and on cool summer nights. They work well at bedtime, I often sleep in one when it&#8217;s colder. In the morning, putting on a hoodie to drink your tea outside in the sunshine is a great feeling.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m almost certain hoodies were made for runners. Especially during the fall, lacing up a trusty pair of tennis shoes, pulling a hoodie over your head and taking to the road is blissful.</p>

<p>Zip-up, pull-over, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ve always found a sense of comfort when I pull a freshly cleaned hooded sweatshirt out of the dryer. They&#8217;ll be something I&#8217;ll always own.</p>
