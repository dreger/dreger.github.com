<h2>Oreo</h2> 
<p class="meta">July 17, 2012 &middot; <a href="/oreo.html">Permalink</a></p>
<section class="article-content">
<p>My girlfriend and I talk frequently about spiritual things. We talk about the Bible. We talk about Jesus and His life. Mostly, however, we talk about using God to strengthen our relationship, and help each other grow. We&#8217;re not perfect by any means, but I&#8217;m really blessed to have someone as God-centered as she is.</p>

<p>While talking a couple weeks ago, we found ourselves on the topic of us and our relationship with Him. A couple of days focused on each other, and not enough on our spiritual health, left us feeling like we weren&#8217;t clicking as usual. It was here that I stumbled onto a delicious little analogy that summarizes the sort of relationship we&#8217;re striving for. Milk&#8217;s favorite cookie, the Oreo.</p>

<p>The analogy goes like this: imagine my girlfriend and I as the cookie parts of an Oreo, and God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit as the creamy, delicious filling. If it were just us two cookies, there wouldn&#8217;t be anything to hold us together; we would easily fall apart. However, when you put creamy-center God into the equation, the cookies stick together quite well. Only by holding on for dear cookie life to God can we stay connected, forever, with each other.</p>

<p>This analogy really works for us. Probably because we&#8217;re half crazy, but also because there&#8217;s some real truth in there. Whenever we feel a little off, or just need some encouragement, one of us will text the other &#8220;Oreo,&#8221; and it helps us refocus on what really makes &#8220;us&#8221; work. Loving Jesus truly makes you a better lover, and I&#8217;m sure if He could have tried one, our Lord probably would have loved Oreos too.</p>

<h2>Written in the Star(s)bucks</h2> 
<p class="meta">June 08, 2012 &middot; <a href="/written-in-the-starbucks.html">Permalink</a></p>
<section class="article-content">
<p>I haven’t accomplished much writing today. So, in lieu of staying inside and eating more cereal, I put on jeans and and a belt and drove over to my local Starbucks. In a lot of ways, this coffee shop mirrors my writing. There’s not much else I could do here, except write. I can’t load up the Xbox, make something to eat, or try and socialize with the roommates down the hall; just write. It suits me.</p>

<p>Which is why I find myself solo tonight in the local Starbucks. I got here and checked-in with Foursqure, something else I’ve really come to appreciate as time has gone on. Being able to look back at my history of check-ins and see where I’ve gone has been insightful to my life in general. Dustin Curtis once quipped that Foursquare is the Facebook of the future. I don’t know if that is completely true, but the abstracted version of what he’s saying is that the future of social lies in what we’re really doing. Not just status updates.</p>

<p>Funny place, Starbucks. I remember when they only use to have coffee and a small array of items. Now they have walls of cups, blends and a full on snack bar. That blueberry coffee cake looks good, but it’s a little too expensive for me right now – I haven’t even finished my grande mocha.</p>

<p>Along with coffee, Starbucks has gotten increasingly good at another thing: seating people really close to one another. This is remarkable on two levels. 1.) People don’t seem to notice that the threshold for what could be considered my “bubble” is dangerously near to being crossed, and 2.) people think you can’t hear them talk at low levels from four feet away. Remarkable.</p>

<p>I’m sure I look like such a tool right now. Rocking my Apple Macbook with iPhone set beside me as I drink a grande white-chocolate mocha. Thankfully I have no hair, otherwise I’m sure it would complete the look. Out hipstering the hipsters, maybe I have accomplished something tonight.</p>

<p>My coffee has finally reached the point of equilibrium: I can now drink a steady stream and not viciously raze the small village of my tastebuds with scalding lava. Words are fun.</p>

<p>The barista is pulling out the items from the snack bar now, wrapping them in saran and putting them away for tomorrow. I always knew this sort of thing happened, obviously they can’t leave the food in there indefinitely, but I’ve never actually seen it being done.</p>

<p>My coffee cup is now empty, after I shotgunned the last teaspoon of pure sugary chocolate confection. Decaf probably would have been a better choice for this time at night, but you don’t go to Starbucks to get decaf. That would be like going to McDonalds to get a salad – a complete waste of time. If you’ve already made it into the building, you are bound by society law to getting that Big Mac with fries, er.. mocha with whipped cream.</p>

<p>This has proven productive. Forcing myself to go somewhere where I’d be cornered, literally and metaphorically, into writing has been successful. This was fun.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just need to change up the setting and remove the “crutches” preventing you from doing what you love. Kick those crutches out from under you, and you just might stand. Try it, I’ll take you out for coffee afterwards and we can read the awesome thing you wrote. It doesn’t even matter if it sucks, just so long as you did something to give yourself the opportunity to write again. At the end of the night, that’s what will make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Write it down</h2> 
<p class="meta">May 29, 2012 &middot; <a href="/write-it-down.html">Permalink</a></p>
<section class="article-content">
<p>Last night, my roommates and I watched Christopher Nolan’s 2000 film, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/'>Memento</a>. If you think that Inception, or Pulp Fiction was confusing the first time through, Memento can definitely be added to the list of movies that will give you brain whiplash.</p>

<p>Without going into the actual story, Memento follows Lenard, a man who cannot create new memories. He remembers everything in his past, just cannot create new memories. “Everything just fades” he says.</p>

<p>Only being able to remember what has happened within the last couple minutes, Lenard carries around a Polaroid camera and takes pictures of the key people / places he has been. On the back of the photos, he writes down short notes – clues – to help him piece everything back together when his memories fade again.</p>

<p>Watching this all transpire, the slogan of my favorite paper- notebook maker, Field Notes, came into my mind:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m not writing it down to remember it later. I’m writing it down to remember it now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lenard was able to survive purely on the fact that he wrote down the things he knew he would forget. It was a matter of life and death for him.</p>

<p>For most of us, however, it’s not a matter of life or death, but rather whether we remember to return the Redbox on time, pick up the milk, or make that phone call. None of these things are huge, but each are important in their own way, and it is a hassle whenever we forget to do them.</p>

<p>I’ve been scribbling notes down for a couple years now, and I’m still refining my methods. However, one technique which is incredibly effective, and not necessarily apparent, is to write down everything. You really have to push the boundaries of what you’re used to constituting as a “note.” If you started writing down all the little things that clutter up your mind throughout the day (quotes, thoughts for a project, the first lyric of a song), imagine how much less preoccupied your thoughts would be.</p>

<p>Try it. Write down everything that makes you think, “hey, I want to come back to this later.” You will feel less cluttered and able to focus better on the task at hand; all while knowing that the awesome thing you thought of will still be there, and awesome, later.</p>

<h2>Orientation, questions and the CEO</h2> 
<p class="meta">May 14, 2012 &middot; <a href="/orientation-questions-and-the-ceo.html">Permalink</a></p>
<section class="article-content">
<p>Today marks the end of Orientation Day at <a href='http://timken.com'>The Timken Company</a>. Hats off to the University relations team for putting together a great program for us; I&#8217;ve been to much shorter programs which felt twice as long. Informative, fun and a great way to get our feet wet the first day.</p>

<p>I took plenty of things away from today, including one of the amazing spare lunches (boxed <a href='http://www.honeybakedham.com/catering.asp'>Honey Baked Ham sandwiches</a>), but what I&#8217;m most impressed with is how well they treat their interns. It&#8217;s a foundation of respect that you feel, even though you&#8217;re the lowest ones on the totem pole.</p>

<p>I turned out to be quite a successful at all the activities we had participated in today, netting three different gift cards as prizes, but something I wasn&#8217;t expecting was a live presentation from the CEO and current President: <a href='http://www.timken.com/en-us/about/leadership/Pages/JamesWGriffith.aspx'>James W. Griffith</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how many CEO&#8217;s of companies as large as Timken make time to come to an intern orientation day, but there can&#8217;t be many. Seeing President Griffith and being able to spend 45 some minutes listening to him speak and then having our own personal Q&amp;A session was awesome. As much as I respected his position before this morning, I respect him that much more for making time for us.</p>

<h3 id='smart_people_ask_questions'>Smart people ask questions</h3>

<p>Something that the session with President Griffith reminded me of was an article by Tommy MacWilliam called <a href='http://blog.tommymacwilliam.com/post/17500383225/what-ive-learned-about-smart-people'>What I&#8217;ve Learned About Smart People</a>. MacWilliam is a student at Harvard and has had the chance to be around <em>a lot</em> of incredibly intelligent individuals. From this, and the fact he seems to be a pretty bright guy himself, he&#8217;s noticed that <strong>smart people ask questions</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smart people are different. If they don’t understand something, or even if they think they understand something, they’ll ask questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So true.</p>

<p>It was this idea that persuaded me to raise my hand and ask President Griffith a question. I don&#8217;t remember exactly what I asked, it was something about how heavily Timken takes a business&#8217;s patents into account when looking to acquire that company, but I knew I had to ask something.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say I wasn&#8217;t really nervous and scribbled down a draft of my question to get the wording right, but after asking, not only did I feel proud - I also got a great response and direct conversation with the CEO.</p>

<p>Asking questions, especially when you are surrounded by people way smarter than yourself is always going to be intimidating. You don&#8217;t want to sound stupid, or ask something that isn&#8217;t relevant, but regardless how nervous you feel, just ask. Make it a good question and ask. It&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<h3 id='alarm_set_for_710_am'>Alarm set for 7:10 AM</h3>

<p>Tomorrow will mark my first <em>actual</em> day of work for The Timken Company. It seems like a decade has passed since I first submitted my application and resumé. I&#8217;m ready to dive in. Here we go.</p>

<h2>Lens</h2> 
<p class="meta">May 10, 2012 &middot; <a href="/lens.html">Permalink</a></p>
<section class="article-content">
<p>I just made my first camera lens in Adobe Illustrator. Following the awesome <a href='http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustration/create-an-aperture-style-camera-lens-icon/'>tutorial on Tuts+</a>, it took me about two hours to complete. I&#8217;ve got lots of improving to do, but I&#8217;ve always wanted to learn how to make something this intricate and downright cool.</p>

<p>Illustration is a world I&#8217;ve long looked at, but never really set foot in like I did with web design. However, after only two hours working on the camera lens, I realized that I have a strong passion for this type of design. Being able to create <em>anything</em> I can think of makes me feel enlivened.</p>

<p>With enough effort, anyone can learn practically anything with the Internet. Hopefully by the end of this summer, I will be a much better illustrator than I am now, and have learned a new way to create things I enjoy.</p>
