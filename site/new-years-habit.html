<h2>New Year's Habit</h2> 
<p class="meta">December 31, 2011 &middot; <a href="/new-years-habit.html">Permalink</a></p>
<section class="article-content">
<p>As I contemplate 2012, less than 12 hours away at this time, I&#8217;m thinking about the New Year resolutions. While I was thinking, I read a <a href='http://zenhabits.net/fitguide/'>post by Leo Babauta on Zen Habits</a> about aiming to create new habits for the new year, rather than setting &#8220;resolutions&#8221;. While the article focused on health, there were universal comments about helping to create healthy habits and have them stick. I particularly like this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of creating a list of resolutions this year, create a new habit. Habits last, and they lead to long-term fitness (and more). They require more patience, but they are worth the wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changing, or creating, long-term habits are hard. Often times we set unrealistic expectations of what we want to be able to achieve and become disheartened when we can&#8217;t reach those goals. This doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t overcome huge obstacles and accomplish great things, but rather we need to be realistic about the journey to get there. A good source of inspiration comes from Matthew 19:26 (NIV):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus looked at them and said, <span class='jesus'>"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So true, just be careful not to change &#8220;with God all things are possible&#8221; to &#8220;with God all things are easy&#8221;. Change is never easy, but the results and experience along the way are well worth the effort. Be positive, adapt and learn to embrace the journey.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to a safe New Year&#8217;s eve and a great start to 2012.</p>
