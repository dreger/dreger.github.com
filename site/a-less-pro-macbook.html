<h2>A less Pro Macbook</h2>

<p><em>(Update: I ended up sticking with my Macbook Pro. I love it too much.)</em></p>

<p>I recently got myself a 13&#8217; Macbook Pro. This thing flies. It is absolutely great for anything that needs a little extra horsepower and it performs really well with anything I throw at it. However, it feels like overkill. More importantly, it is making me feel like I&#8217;m losing touch with what I really <em>need</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want power. The sad truth is that no amount of CPU or RAM is going to make me sit down and actually start writing. What I want is something simpler, less fancy. Where I&#8217;m the one supplying the power.</p>

<p>My thoughts turned to the Macbook Air as a possible replacement. It&#8217;s less powerful, much more light and would easilly go with me wherever I wanted to go. I hate staying in my dorm when I work, but the thought of adding seven extra pounds to my backpack just to bring my laptop along makes me cringe.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read plenty of posts online saying that the MBA is capable of doing development work, one of the only things I was worried about. I&#8217;m going to continue looking around and maybe try to find a buyer for my practically brand new Macbook Pro. I appreciate the power, but I just don&#8217;t need it.</p>
