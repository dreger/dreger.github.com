<h2>Spoken word "Love"</h2>

<p>Had an interesting reflection experience.</p>

<p>I felt really inspired after watching <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/bball1989'>some of Jeff Bethke&#8217;s videos</a>. I took this inspiration, along with my Macbook, and went to the BnB cafe. I grabbed a drink, sat down and took some quiet time to clear my mind. What I ended up doing was writing my first “spoken word” poetry piece. I really liked how it turned out, so I got creative and even <a href='http://youtu.be/ZPvXsyCDYs0'>made a video</a> for it. It was a really great way for me to reflect; I felt in the zone and was really surprised at how refreshed I felt afterwards. Hopefully this is the start of something new for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstinence is hard / And no, that’s not a pun / In fact the fight against temptation / Is the farthest thing from fun.</p>

<p>But He never puts us where / He’s knows we can’t succeed / Just don’t try to fight alone / For only through Him are we freed.</p>

<p>True grace comes from devotion / We have the armor of our Lord / But if you close your heart and ignore His word / You’ll fall on your own sword.</p>

<p>So guys, lead with grace / I know she feels like your life / But respect her how you’d want another man / to respect your future wife.</p>

<p>Dear Lord keep us joyful / As we go our separate ways / May our minds remain on you / To give you ever-constant praise</p>

<p>Let us be bold for your message / You already paid the cost / Keep our convictions to you strong / When we’re surrounded by the lost.</p>

<p>And let us lead them to you / To seek your mercy from above / For leading the lost to Jesus / Is the truest definition of love.</p>
