		<p>Admidst my finals, I wanted to take a break and share an excerpt from one of my papers. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s the lack of sleep, or overdose of caffeine, but I&rsquo;m particularly proud of this closing paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ask any creative - writer, designer or artist - and they will tell you that their work is never done. Even in our downtime, our minds are constantly growing organic ideas planted in the soil of our experiences. As we move from project to project our skills become more refined, and allow for new avenues of opportunity to be explored. It is a never-ending cycle for those who strive to create something for the world</p></blockquote>

<!-- *[class name]* gave me the opportunity to hone my skills, and make some real mistakes. In the three example documents I outlined above, you only see the final polished result. What remains invisible, or rather embedded in the DNA of each piece, are the tens of hundreds of small mistakes I made along the way. It is in these mistakes that I take the most pride. In the words of former IBM CEO, Thomas Watson Sr., â€œif you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate." My failures have illuminated a new avenue forward for my work, and I happily carry each lesson learned as I say goodbye to this semester.  -->
