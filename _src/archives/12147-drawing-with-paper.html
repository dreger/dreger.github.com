<p>I&rsquo;ve had this iPad for a couple weeks now, and something that always seems to surprise me is how easy it is for people to just pick up and start using.</p>

<p>This is particularly highlighted by my recent attempts to put Xubuntu on my grandfather&rsquo;s aging iBook. Device drivers be darned.</p>

<p>When people pick up the iPad, there is some level of intuitiveness that they just get. Most recently, I was letting my girlfriend explore around and she opened up Paper by 53. Paper is an amazing sketching/painting/drawing app with an even more amazing interface. After showing her how to pull up the different brushes, I didn&rsquo;t give her any more guidance and she created the picture you see above.</p>

<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t taken the iPad away, she would still probably be drawing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said for this type of interaction, and that&rsquo;s why Apple is world known. They&rsquo;ve created something magical that lets the user dive into the app and create, not just consume. As much as I enjoy using the iPad myself, there is something even more cool about watching others use it. Especially if it is their first time in a particular app.</p>
