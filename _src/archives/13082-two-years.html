<p>Timothy Keller once wrote that there is no feeling like &ldquo;the profound satisfaction of being known <em>and</em> loved.&rdquo; Over the past two years, Emily has shown me that she not only loves me, but all my quirks as well. It&rsquo;s a profound feeling of peace and safety that I have affectionately come to call &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Amongst everything else, I find it incredible that I&rsquo;ve found a girl who has redefined such a fundamental term for me.</p>

<p>Keeping it <a href="/archives/12199-oreo.html">Oreo focused</a>, making time for coffee dates, and chasing down the occasional stray animal to try and make it our pet, I cannot wait to see where God leads us during the next year. I couldn&rsquo;t be more happy.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We love - because he first loved us.&rdquo; (1 John 4:19)</p></blockquote>

<p>Love you, sweetheart.</p>
