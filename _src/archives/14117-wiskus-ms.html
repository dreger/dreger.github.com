		<p>Dave Wiskus, an iOS developer, writing about his experience at the 2014 Microsoft Build conference:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I say that walking around the floor of Microsoft’s Build conference was weird, I don’t mean that from the perspective of an iOS designer who crossed enemy lines. I felt more like some kind of war-torn refugee, returning to find that home had been rebuilt into a palace. For all the years I spent trying to escape from this company, the place seemed friendly. Bright colors, poppy music, happy people. Tones of Microsoft’s trademark dorkiness, for sure. But cut with a new sincerity.</p></blockquote>

<p>If I had to pick one word to sum up the first few months of <a href="/archives/14035-satya-nadella.html">Satya Nadella&rsquo;s</a> tenure at Microsoft, I would chose &ldquo;sincere.&rdquo; From Windows Phone 8.1 (which seems great) to the growing popularity of Microsoft Azure (their cloud-based developer tools), we are beginning to see the (re)building of an ethos that hasn&rsquo;t been around for a long time.</p>
