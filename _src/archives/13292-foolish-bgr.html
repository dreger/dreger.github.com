		<p>Brad Reed, writing for <em>BGR</em>, wins this week&rsquo;s <em>Foolish Reporting</em> award for his ridiculously misleading headline writing. The headline in question? &ldquo;iPhone user hates iOS 7 so much that he&rsquo;s suing Apple over it&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote><p>Brighter colors and flat icons just aren&rsquo;t for everybody. That said, it seems that iPhone user Mark Menacher hates them much more than anyone else. CNET reports that Menacher has actually filed a suit against Apple in small claims court and is asking the company to let him remove the iOS 7 install file from his iOS devices.</p></blockquote>

<p>Everything in this article would have you believe that Menacher hates iOS 7 so much that he&rsquo;s willing to sue Tim Cook over it. But that&rsquo;s a lie. From the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57608171-37/apple-taken-to-court-over-unwanted-ios-7-install-download/">original article on the case</a> by Josh Lowensohn for <em>CNET</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mark Menacher, a resident of Poway, Calif., filed <a href="http://courtindex.sdcourt.ca.gov/CISPublic/casedetail?casenum=201300313457&amp;casesite=KM&amp;applcode=C">a small-claims complaint</a> against Apple&rsquo;s CEO Tim Cook in the Superior Court of California in San Diego on Thursday, asking for the removal of the iOS 7 install file &ndash; something that&rsquo;s downloaded to devices automatically when they&rsquo;re connected to power and a Wi-Fi connection.</p></blockquote>

<p>iOS 7 didn&rsquo;t even install on Menacher&rsquo;s device, so how could he hate it? He never said he did. Rather, he&rsquo;s upset that the installer file takes up more than 1 GB of space and was downloaded automatically &mdash; a legitimate complaint.</p>
