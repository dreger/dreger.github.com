		<p><em>(Update: I ended up sticking with my Macbook Pro. I love it too much.)</em></p>

<p>I recently got myself a 13' Macbook Pro. This thing flies. It is absolutely great for anything that needs a little extra horsepower and it performs really well with anything I throw at it. However, it feels like overkill. More importantly, it is making me feel like I&rsquo;m losing touch with what I really <em>need</em>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want power. The sad truth is that no amount of CPU or RAM is going to make me sit down and actually start writing. What I want is something simpler, less fancy. Where I&rsquo;m the one supplying the power.</p>

<p>My thoughts turned to the Macbook Air as a possible replacement. It&rsquo;s less powerful, much more light and would easilly go with me wherever I wanted to go. I hate staying in my dorm when I work, but the thought of adding seven extra pounds to my backpack just to bring my laptop along makes me cringe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read plenty of posts online saying that the MBA is capable of doing development work, one of the only things I was worried about. I&rsquo;m going to continue looking around and maybe try to find a buyer for my practically brand new Macbook Pro. I appreciate the power, but I just don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
