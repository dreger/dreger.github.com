		<p>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/23First-Weekend-iPhone-Sales-Top-Nine-Million-Sets-New-Record.html">just announced</a> that they sold over nine million new iPhones this past weekend, breaking all previous records for a product launch. They also noted that over 200 million users have upgraded to iOS 7.</p>

<h3>iPhone Sales</h3>

<p>Make no mistake, nine million is a huge number for Apple on a product launch weekend. However, since we weren&rsquo;t given the breakdown of sales between the 5C and 5S, I&rsquo;m going to take this one with a grain of salt &mdash; especially since <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html">Apple sold over five million</a> iPhone 5s on launch weekend last year.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario, Apple sold 4.5 million of each new iPhone, breaking no single-device record, but still selling a boatload of phones.</p>

<h3>iOS 7 Adoption Rate</h3>

<p>At their September 10th event this year, Apple announced they would be <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715256/apple-700-million-ios-devices-sold-by-end-of-september">shipping their 700 millionth</a> iOS device by the end of September. Today, with over 200 million users now running iOS 7, this means that Apple has nearly 28% adoption for a three-day-old operating system. That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>

<p>SIDE NOTE: Living on a university campus, even one with decently fast internet, the iOS 7 launch absolutely crippled our network. Browsing tweets and Facebook posts from friends at other schools confirmed this was not an isolated issue.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a huge three days for Apple. And, keeping my ear open to the conversations on campus, it seems iOS 7 is gaining both appreciation and support the more people use it.</p>
