		<p>After returning from Christmas break, I noticed a lot of students carrying around Microsoft Surface tablets. I see these devices in meetings, in class, and anywhere there is a surface (ha) to put them. What I have yet to see, however, is anyone using the Surface exclusively as a tablet.</p>

<p>I have had the chance to use these devices, and they are good laptops if you like Windows, but they are not good tablets. They&rsquo;re heavy (comparatively), Windows 8 is still sketchy to use without a mouse, and the stylus is, well, another thing you have to keep track of.</p>

<p>The Surface is first and foremost a laptop. Regardless the convergence of Windows 8 with a touchscreen, the Surface does not, to me, represent a better product than two separate devices, designed specifically for each type of product category.</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday, three of Apple&rsquo;s executive team &mdash; Phillip Schiller, Bud Tribble, and Craig Federighi &mdash; sat down with <em>MacWorld&rsquo;s</em> Jason Snell <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2090829/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html">for an interview on the past 30 years of the Macintosh</a>.</p>

<p>As I read, it only became clearer that the Mac is, and will forever be, a separate product, with its own strengths that add to the Apple lineup.</p>

<p>Federighi:</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s obvious and easy enough to slap a touchscreen on a piece of hardware, but is that a good experience? We believe, no.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Schiller:</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s not an either/or. It’s a world where you’re going to have a phone, a tablet, a computer, you don’t have to choose. And so what’s more important is how you seamlessly move between them all … it’s not like this is a laptop person and that’s a tablet person. It doesn’t have to be that way.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Apple clearly sees a strength, and differentiation from the competition, by offering different devices for different types of uses. They want users to choose the best tool for the job, instead of being forced to use one product for everything.</p>
