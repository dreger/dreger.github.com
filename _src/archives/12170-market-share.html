		<p>I was speaking with my father this morning around 2:00 AM and somehow we got on the topic of WWDC.</p>

<p>My father is not as savvy as I when it comes to computer technology, however he holds his own amongst his peers. As I was explaining Apple&rsquo;s newest flagship laptop, the Macbook Pro Retina, I could see him grimacing as I explained the lack of upgrade options and removal of an optical drive. “They eliminate a lot of customers by doing that,” he said. “At some point, you&rsquo;re going to start cutting into how much market share you can really get when you remove things people need, by trying to make everything thinner and lighter.”</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>The new Macbook Pro Retina is <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/opinion-apple-retina-displa/">not meant to be taken apart</a>. In order to make it as thin and light as it is, almost everything is either soldiered or glued together. iFixIt&rsquo;s crew even gave it a terribly low 1/10 Repairability Score (10 being the easiest to repair).</p>

<p>This got me thinking about how Apple actually approaches their business. And the conclusion I came to is that Apple doesn&rsquo;t base their decisions around “market share” when it comes to hardware. Let that sink in for a moment. We&rsquo;re not talking about iOS or Mac OSX, where they do want as much market share as possible, we&rsquo;re talking about when Apple builds a new-category type of product.</p>

<p>Several times throughout the Macbook Pro Retina video, Apple executives talked about letting go of the past as a way to create for the future. That&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;ve done with the new Macbook Pro. They don&rsquo;t care if it works for everyone, but what they do care about is making the thinnest and most powerful, high resolution laptop in the world; eventually having those features trickle down into their full product line.</p>

<p>I imagine that as Jony Ive works on the next version of the iPhone, Mac Pro and iPad, he&rsquo;s not making products that will be the most “market share” friendly. He&rsquo;s making products that will drive Apple forward, and pull the rest of the industry behind it.</p>
