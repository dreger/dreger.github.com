# The KD Manual of Style

abcde­fghijklmnopqrstu­vwxyz­abcde­fghijklmnopqrstu­vwxyz­abcd

This document serves as the living styleguide for [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com). I base my stylistic decisions off of the _New York Times Manual of Style_, and then reference this guide. The goal is to bring a consistent voice to all my writing.
