		<p>Quietly shipped alongside all that was released on Tuesday, iOS 7.0.3 is now available for download.</p>

<p>In addition to iCloud Keychain, which lets you sync your passwords between iOS devices, Apple has also addressed complaints regarding the system-wide parallax effects. Federico Viticci for <em>MacStories</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple has listened, and in iOS 7.0.3 the Reduce Motion setting (available in General > Accessibility) now truly reduces animations: switching to apps and back to Home screen, unlocking the device, and moving between folders is now a cross-fade that is much faster than Appleâ€™s animations with Reduce Motion turned off.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank goodness. Although I really liked iOS 7, those transitions were time consuming and felt unnecessary. The cross-fade effect could be quicker still, but it&rsquo;s a huge improvement from before.</p>
