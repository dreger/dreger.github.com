		<p>I went on a <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/346820510526615553">small rant about social scoreboards</a> the other day and have been thinking about social analytics ever since.</p>

<p>Remember that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/16/ashton.cnn.twitter.battle/index.html">competition to reach a million followers</a> between Ashton Kutcher and CNN? We&rsquo;re mildly obsessed with stats related to us, and sites like Twitter and Facebook make sure to put those numbers where we can see them. Social analytics can be a powerful tool when used as data, but I worry when those numbers start causing change in emotions and actions.</p>

<p>One of the places I&rsquo;ve noticed this affecting me is right here, on my own website.</p>

<p>For a couple years I&rsquo;ve run Google Analytics behind-the-scenes to record the number of visitors and page-views this site has generated. It&rsquo;s been fun to publish a piece and then check the realtime stats, but there hasn&rsquo;t ever been any <strong>real</strong> reason to do this. I don&rsquo;t write that often, no page-view reliant revenue is being generated, and the numbers aren&rsquo;t anything incredibly substantial. Yet I would check them. Every. Time.</p>

<p>Even though GA doesn&rsquo;t cost any money to run, it&rsquo;s quietly put emotional tariffs on every piece I&rsquo;ve published; subtlety tying the joy of writing to the number of eyeballs that read it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not a tax I want to pay anymore, and I&rsquo;ve decided to remove any analytics that previously monitored this site. When I write here, I want to take as much joy from the experience as possible. By removing the ability to see who&rsquo;s reading, I&rsquo;ve given myself back the ability to write freely - regardless who sees it.</p>
