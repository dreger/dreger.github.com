		<p>I&rsquo;ve found that as I write papers for class, sometimes I hit a wall. This isn&rsquo;t a full case of writers block, rather I feel the enthusiasm start to fade. What was just a feverish output of thoughts to typed characters is starting to die. Eventually, I&rsquo;ve stopped writing and am looking at my cursor blink. Blink. Blink. Blink.</p>

<p>This is when I hit Command + &ldquo;N&rdquo; and open up a new document. Without thinking more than a few seconds, I start &ldquo;cold&rdquo; writing about anything I want. Stacking wood, running in the snow, listening to instrumental music - anything that comes to mind. The block is gone, my writing flame has recaptured it&rsquo;s intensity and I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;ll pound out 500 words on this new topic in the time it took me to get 200 for the first one.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m done, I return to my original document. Every single time I do, the writers block is gone and I get back to typing. This sort of &ldquo;cold writing&rdquo; to jumpstart my spirit is a great exercise. I don&rsquo;t do it every time I write a paper, however once or twice throughout the course of a longer essay is normal. I&rsquo;m not worried about the time I lose when doing these short side-articles; the small amount of time I invest to reset my thoughts and come back focused is well worth it.</p>

<p>Some of my ideas for blog posts have come from cold writing. In fact, this post you&rsquo;re reading was being written as I worked on a paper assigned for when I get back from spring break. Writing to get rid of writer&rsquo;s block, go figure.</p>
