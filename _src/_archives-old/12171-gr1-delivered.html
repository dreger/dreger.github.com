		<p>My GORUCK GR1 arrived today.</p>

<p>I want to write a longer review after I get done dragging it through Georgia next week, but here are some quick impressions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Damn this is a nice bag. I&rsquo;m 5'8â€³, weigh around 150 and this bag fits great. My previous Radio Ruck was a good fit, but the GR1 really hugs my body with all my gear in it.</li>
<li>The GR1 can fit a ton, the pockets are deep and the slightly angled bottom keeps the weight higher on my back. I needed some extra space, and it delivers.</li>
<li>It looks great. Any color, so long as it&rsquo;s black.</li>
<li>After just a couple hours, you can tell this bag exudes quality. Every detail was thought out, and anything that wasn&rsquo;t needed was cut out. This leaves you with a minimalistic piece of gear that performs at a high level.</li>
</ul>


<p>Only having it a few hours, I&rsquo;m not afraid to say this is the last bag I will ever buy. The Radio Ruck will be great for a lot of people, but for my college student athlete needs, and a love of traveling, this bag is perfect.</p>
