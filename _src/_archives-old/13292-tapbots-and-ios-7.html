		<p>When iOS 7 was announced, it instantly made most of the apps in the App Store look old and outdated; apps that had previously made heavy use of graphics and images looked out of place in contrast to iOS 7&rsquo;s flatness.</p>

<p>One of my favorite app developer teams, <a href="http://tapbots.com">Tapbots</a>, was hit particularly hard by the iOS 7 announcement. Over the past several years, the Tapbots team, Mark Jardine (design) and Paul Haddad (code), had built a company by designing highly-customized user interfaces for their applications. I was curious how they&rsquo;d respond to the changes.</p>

<p>In an <a href="http://www.macworld.com/video/26841/paul-haddad-on-tweetbot-and-calcbot.html">interview with <em>Macworld</em></a> following the announcement of iOS 7 at Apple&rsquo;s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), Haddad made the following comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t think we have to match exactly what&rsquo;s there [in iOS 7], but we definitely have to take some of the cues that, you know, they&rsquo;re giving us.
[&hellip;]
Today might kind of throw everything up in the air, because we&rsquo;ll have to go back and look at how much we&rsquo;re going to change.</p></blockquote>

<p>By far, Tapbots most popular app is Tweetbot; a powerful Twitter client that lets you easily manage multiple accounts, view conversation threads, and is also my personal favorite . After WWDC, Tapbots had remained particularly quiet about any progress, and Tweetbot was looking older with every passing day. However, this past Thursday, Jardine gave an <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/business/tapbots-and-the-state-of-our-apps-in-ios7">update on the company blog</a> regarding the past few months:</p>

<blockquote><p>Playing with the beta of iOS7 over the next few weeks brought us to the realization that this would not just be a &ldquo;re-skin&rdquo;. We really had to just start over with the new foundation and concepts of iOS7.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been working night and day for the last 4 months to re-design and develop an app [Tweetbot] that took over a year to build. The good news is that we are extremely happy with the results and can&rsquo;t wait to share it with everyone.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Jardine, Tweetbot 3 has been submitted to the App Store and is awaiting approval. Like I&rsquo;ve said before, <a href="/archives/13275-paying-for-software.html">great software takes time</a>, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Tapbots has spent the last four months building.</p>
