		<p><strong>Update:</strong> The <em>Alliance Review</em> has posted <a href="http://www.the-review.com/local%20news/2014/02/15/chamber-seminar-focuses-on-mobile-technology">the online version of the article</a> that covered my presentation.</p>

<p>Whew, last week was packed for me. If you noticed the irregular publishing schedule, I apologize. Let me show you what took up most of my time.</p>

<p>About three months ago, I was asked by my university&rsquo;s Office of Marketing to create a presentation about mobile applications. The audience would be a mix of business- and marketing-focused professionals, and my job was to both educate and advise as to the current state of mobile applications.</p>

<p>Although it does not have my notes, you can see the slides I created below. This should help you get a feeling for the direction and areas I focused on.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="aedfda70794d01313f054e5d868db85e" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p>At a high level, the outline went something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>To start, I focused on the beginning of the mobile application revolution, which I identify as the time after Apple introduced the iPhone.</li>
<li>Next, I moved to the unique differences between web applications and native applications.</li>
<li>Finally, I showed some off some of the companies who are doing interesting things between their existing websites and their mobile efforts.</li>
</ol>


<p>The whole presentation went very well. It was truly an honor to present to those in attendance, and I would like to thank everyone involved with helping make it a success.</p>

<p>One of the last slides I used was of a photographer, and I closed with the following lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of my favorite sayings is &ldquo;the best camera is the one you have with you.&rdquo; But let me turn this around a bit and say: &ldquo;the best customer is the one you can always be with.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
