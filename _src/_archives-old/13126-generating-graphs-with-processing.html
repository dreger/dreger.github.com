		<p><a href="http://designforfun.com/display.php?id=128">Ben Barry&rsquo;s post</a> on designing the 2011 Facebook f8 Conference remains one of my favorite pieces about design on the internet. As I was reading back through it the other day, I came across how Barry had gone about generating those signature Facebook graph images.</p>

<blockquote><p>While working on <a href="http://designforfun.com/display.php?id=99">f8 2010</a> we developed a rudimentary Processing script that allowed us to generate graph imagery. For 2011 we dusted it off and polished it up. With a some additional work we developed a robust tool that allowed us to rapidly iterate and develop graphics for a variety of applications. Because of the speed and flexibility it afforded us the entire graphic system for this years f8 was built using imagery generated with Processing.</p></blockquote>

<p>With nothing to do on my Saturday night, I downloaded <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a> and thought I&rsquo;d try to recreate Barry&rsquo;s technique.</p>

<img src="http://cargo.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/3344.5784graph.png" alt="more graphs" /></p>

<p>I ended up getting pretty close.</p>

<p>My script, which I ended up calling GraphMaker, starts by randomly placing nodes on the canvas. It then goes through every node and gets a list of nodes within a certain distance to that particular one. Then it&rsquo;s a simple matter of drawing lines from the original node to a limited number of close neighbors.</p>

<p>The results looked good, and I spent at least half an hour <strong>just</strong> tweaking all the parameters that go with each node (color, size, max distance a line can be between two nodes).</p>

<p>However, even though the graphs from my script look similar to the ones from f8, there&rsquo;s one significant flaw that I could never figure out how to fix: overlapping nodes.</p>

<p>Regardless how dense Barry&rsquo;s graphs, no node ever overlaps any of its neighbors - mine do. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but one that significantly impacted the quality of my images at the beginning. Eventually, I was able to compensate by having each node retain a slight transparency which enables you to still see individual nodes even when they overlap.</p>

<p>For now, my random-graph-making itch has been scratched, but I hope to revisit this one day and implement a check to ensure that each new node has a little space from its neighbor. Until then, feel free to check out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kyledreger/5519425">script on GitHub</a> and have some fun.</p>

<p>The final interesting thing from this experiment, that my girlfriend actually pointed out to me, is that each image resembles a constellation. Funny, yet oddly profound when taken in context with our own social graphs and the world around us.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A reader, Lalith P., sent me an email with <a href="https://github.com/cuttarug/graph-imagery">his solution</a> to the overlapping-nodes problem I was having. Thanks, Lalith!</p>
