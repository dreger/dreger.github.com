		<p>Google announced today that they had just <a href="http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html">paid $3.2 billion in cash</a> to acquire Nest, the makers of those <a href="/archives/13281-the-nest-protect.html">gorgeous thermostats</a> and smoke detectors. This acquisition is interesting for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tony Fadell, Nest CEO and ex-Senior Vice President of the iPod Division at Apple, now works for Google.</li>
<li>Google now has a hand in the personal home safety game.</li>
</ol>


<p>My gut reaction is that Google is looking for new ways into the home, and buying Nest was a great way to open the door. If Nest could make thermostats look svelte and sexy, what other boring home appliances have they been wanting to reimagine, but couldn&rsquo;t afford to build? Given Nest&rsquo;s other products, my money&rsquo;s on them going after door locks, power outlets, or something in the kitchen.</p>
