		<p>Zach Epstein, writing for BGR (yup, <a href="/archives/13292-foolish-bgr.html">that BGR</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>The main rear camera is thought to feature a resolution of 13 megapixels, and the phone also includes a standard front-facing camera for video chats as well as Amazon’s Mayday customer service feature.</p>

<p>Beyond those two units, the device houses an additional four front-facing cameras that work with other sensors to facilitate the software’s 3D effects. One source tells us these four cameras, which are situated in each of the four corners on the face of the phone, are low-power infrared cameras.</p>

<p>The device’s extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen.</p></blockquote>

<p>If true, this is a great scoop, and color me interested. But using &ldquo;3D&rdquo; as a feature feels like a gimmick. 3D TV is <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2014/01/3d-tv-dead/356721/">practically</a> <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/samsung-admits-3d-tv-demand-underwhelming-13222753/">dead</a>, and the paralax effect in iOS 7, which <a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-7-and-motion-sickness-poll">gave users motions sickness</a>, was demoted to a toggle switch in the 7.1 update.</p>

<p>A much more interesting feature is going to be how deeply Amazon integrates its services and online store into the device. Think <a href="/archives/14099-amazon-dash.html">Amazon Dash</a>, but built into your smartphone. Huge potential here.</p>
