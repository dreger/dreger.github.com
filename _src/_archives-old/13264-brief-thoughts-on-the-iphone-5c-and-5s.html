		<p>After hitting golfballs for an hour at the range with my brother, I convinced him to swing by our local Verizon Wireless store to check out the iPhone 5C and 5S. Here are some brief thoughts:</p>

<h3>iPhone 5C</h3>

<p>Walking up to the Apple-dedicated section of the store, the first thing that catches your eye is the color of the 5C demo units. A little thicker than the current iPod Touches, the extra weight makes the plastic body feel very much like a premium device. All the buttons on the case feel solid, clicky, and consistent. The front face is essentially the same as a white iPhone 5, but with a subtle, colorful border.</p>

<p>Although not indicative of the 5C&rsquo;s future sales (which I anticipate will be really strong), my brother commented on how much more he liked the colors than the metal look of the 5S.</p>

<h3>iPhone 5S</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s understandable if you think the 5S looks near-identical to the iPhone 5 &mdash; it does.</p>

<p>However, once you pick it up there are some small, noticeable differences. From my brief look, Apple really nailed the colors for the metal backing in the 5S &mdash; the contrast between the face color and the back is much more distinct than with the 5. Whereas the black iPhone 5 looked like one solid color; the 5S&rsquo;s &ldquo;space gray&rdquo; back gives the device a really nice two-toned look. It&rsquo;s the small things.</p>

<p>The most noticeable feature of the 5S is the Touch ID sensor. The home button is now surrounded by a thin ring of metal with the same accent color as the phone. <em>(Also notable: the button lacks the small rounded-rectangle icon that every other iPhone / iPod Touch has.)</em> This extra attention to the home button has left it feeling extremely sturdy, and I think it will hold up much better over time than the previous ones.</p>

<h3>A new standard</h3>

<p>If you look at the Macbook line, you see a product with two tiers: an everyday user &ldquo;air&rdquo; level and a premium &ldquo;pro&rdquo; level. The newest iPhones follow that model. The 5C (Air) is designed to be for everyone; a solid workhorse which is both fun and functional. The 5S (Pro) is the best Apple can create; the best materials and the latest technology.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the hardware design of either iPhone to change drastically over the next few years, rather we&rsquo;ll continue to get fantastic small improvements (Touch ID, better camera) and increasingly powerful software to take advantage of them.</p>
