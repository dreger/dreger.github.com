		<p>You&rsquo;re building a chair.</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a normal, buy-one-at-the-retail-store kind of chair. Your chair is going to be quality, made of the best materials you can afford, and take months to finish.</p>

<p>You work a little each day to design, measure, cut, sand, test, stain, let dry, and prepare the chair for sale. Once you&rsquo;ve finished, you carefully load the chair into the car and drive off to your store.</p>

<p>At the store, you spend an hour positioning the chair near the front window; you want the lights to hit it <em>just right</em>, as to catch the eye of a passerby. You pull out a beautiful card stock price tag and write down &ldquo;$200.&rdquo; After checking everything for one last time, you flip the sign on your front door to <em>OPEN</em> and wait.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two of my favorite games for iOS are <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a> by Loren Brichter and <a href="http://www.andreasilliger.com">Tiny Wings</a> by Andreas Illiger.</p>

<p>Although the game mechanics are very different &mdash; Letterpress a word game, Tiny Wings a side-scrolling adventure &mdash; both of these applications are incredibly well designed and executed. Time and care was taken when creating each sound, animation, and graphic. I often use them as examples of exceptional quality when judging other games in the App Store.</p>

<p>Currently, each game takes different approach to pricing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Letterpress is free to download and play. However, it offers an in-app-purchase (IAP) for $1.99 to unlock new color themes and the ability to have more than two games going at a time. This is a one-time purchase and shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with games like &ldquo;Candy Crush,&rdquo; where you&rsquo;re prompted to <em>repeatedly</em> buy extra lives, powers, etc.</li>
<li>Tiny Wings isn&rsquo;t free and costs $0.99 to purchase. However, once you buy a copy, you get access to the full game.</li>
</ul>


<p>Free for one app ($1.99 for full features), a dollar for the other. However, for as much as I love these games and admire their creators, I&rsquo;ve had to outright argue with my friends about why each app is &ldquo;worth&rdquo; their price, and only barely managed to get my own fiancee to purchase them.</p>

<hr />

<p>You wait several hours, but your chair has yet to sell. Several individuals comment on how much they appreciate &ldquo;real&rdquo; quality and love your craftsmanship, but they say the price is a little too expensive and they&rsquo;ll wait for a sale.</p>

<p>Some customers ask why you&rsquo;ve priced your chair so high. Didn&rsquo;t you see the price of chairs at <em>retail store</em> down the road? Certainly the chairs there aren&rsquo;t as well-made, but they&rsquo;re only $50. And if (when) those chairs break, <em>retail store</em> sells repair kits for just $25! It&rsquo;ll take a long time before the overall prices are close.</p>

<p>As the end of the day approaches, you go to your front door and flip the sign to <em>CLOSED</em>. Driving back home, you pass by <em>retail store</em> and see several individuals walk out carrying repair kits.</p>

<hr />

<p>As of the date this article was published, the top ten &ldquo;top grossing&rdquo; iPhone applications are all free. The same is true for iPad-only applications as well.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;free&rdquo; applications making tons of money isn&rsquo;t the problem. Rather, the issue occurs when prospective buyers instantly disregard any app that&rsquo;s not free. This sort of action is often thoughtless and doesn&rsquo;t consider the enormous amount of work, time, and resources a developer put into their piece of software.</p>

<p>Next time you search for an application in the App Store, don&rsquo;t immediately dismiss those which aren&rsquo;t free. Instead, take a few minutes to actually look at the description and screenshots. If you don&rsquo;t like what you see, don&rsquo;t buy it. Just don&rsquo;t <em>never</em> give them a chance, otherwise you&rsquo;ll be missing out on some of the most lovingly crafted software available today.</p>
