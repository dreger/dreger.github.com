		<p><strong>UPDATE #3:</strong> This whole post is pretty much irrelevant now. Besides the slightly vitriolic nature, the entire Outlook Web App was recently updated to match the aesthetics / functionally of <a href="http://outlook.com">Outlook.com</a> and is incredibly more usable. Post will remain here for posterity.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> I&rsquo;ve found the magical URL which only makes you sign in once: <a href="http://outlook.com/owa/mountunion.edu">outlook.com/owa/mountunion.edu</a>. Just bookmark that and you&rsquo;ll be good to go.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I simplified the instructions for those looking to set up your mobile email <em>without</em> the required passcode. More instructions under the &ldquo;IMAP and POP clients&rdquo; section.</p>

<p>This past week, my iPhone&rsquo;s email just stopped working. It wasn&rsquo;t long before many of my friends began complaining of similar problems. I knew that somewhere, a switch was flipped and the new Mount Union email system was finally set loose.</p>

<p>Students of Mount Union - our webmail has changed. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s taken a turn for the worse. While the increase in storage is nice, it&rsquo;s overshadowed by a terrible, terrible, user experience.</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong>: An upgrade in space from 30 MB to just under 25 GB and lifelong @mountunion.edu access.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong>: Being forced to sign in <strong>twice</strong> on webmail.mountunion.edu.</p>

<p><strong>The Ugly</strong>: Broke existing mobile clients without telling us how to fix them, and the new webmail interface is a complete cluster.</p>

<p>Though the underlying technology took a step forward, we&rsquo;ve taken five <em>usability</em> steps back. Overrun by a terrible color palette, unnecessary gradients and shadows, and unpredictable rendering - the new interface is a complete user experience failure. The old interface wasn&rsquo;t great, but at least it was simple and usable.</p>

<p>Adding sprinkles to this cupcake from the netherworld, many of us who had set up Exchange on our smartphones and tablets had the entire system just stop working. <em>Forcing</em> us to the webmail client.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only good thing about the change is we have more space.
- Anonymous Student</p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly 2,200 students use Mount&rsquo;s email daily. By the end of this post I hope we can fix your existing setup, give you a way to avoid the webmail interface completely, and start enjoying email again.</p>

<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>To get started, scroll down to the section of instructions that applies to you. If everything else fails, take the Reference Instructions below and head to Google. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=imap+setup+for+myclient">already created a search for you</a>, just replace &ldquo;myclient&rdquo; with the name of the application you are trying to set up.</p>

<p>Good luck, friend.</p>

<h3>Reference Instructions</h3>

<p>These settings will be referenced in the sections that follow as we set up new email clients, and fix your existing one.</p>

<pre><code>POP setting
Server name: pod51008.outlook.com
Port: 995
Encryption method: SSL

IMAP setting
Server name: pod51008.outlook.com
Port: 993
Encryption method: SSL

SMTP setting
Server name: pod51008.outlook.com
Port: 587
Encryption method: TLS
</code></pre>

<p>You can also just hand this information to one of your technically-inclined friends, and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll know what to do with them.</p>

<h3>Fix your smartphone or tablet</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> One of the new rules of setting up your mobile device with access to Mount&rsquo;s Exchange email server is that you <strong>must have Passcode Lock on your device</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t have one set (a 4-digit key to unlock your phone / tablet), you will be prompted to create one after finishing the Exchange setup. While I recommend setting one for general security, if you <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to be forced to unlock your phone, skip down &ldquo;IMAP and POP clients&rdquo;.</p>

<h4>iOS Exchange</h4>

<p>For the iOS devices, it&rsquo;s as simple as removing (then re-adding) your email account.</p>

<pre><code>Homescreen &gt; Settings.app &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars
</code></pre>

<p>Select your Mount Union account.</p>

<pre><code>*Scroll to bottom* &gt; Delete Account
</code></pre>

<p><code>Confirm</code> the delete and wait for it to finish removing your account. Once it&rsquo;s done, go back to <code>Mail, Contacts, Calendars</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Add Account... &gt; Microsoft Exchange
</code></pre>

<p>Enter in your full <code>Email</code>, <code>Password</code> and give the <code>Description</code> something like &ldquo;School&rdquo;. Once you&rsquo;re done, click <code>Next</code>.</p>

<p>If you get a &ldquo;Cannot verify server identity&rdquo; popup, just click <code>Continue</code>. If you&rsquo;ve entered all your credentials in correctly, you should see everything verify with a checkmark. You can then resume using your email as usual.</p>

<h4>Android Exchange</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have an Android device to test with. However, I anticipate the course of action being similar to iOS. Simply remove your existing Mount Union email account from the device, then re-add it back. <strong>Note</strong> that with Android Exchange, you may have to set your username in the form of <code>campus\yourusername</code>.</p>

<p>If you have trouble setting up Exchange, jump down to the &ldquo;IMAP and POP clients&rdquo; section for general instructions which should work for you.</p>

<h3>Fix your computer</h3>

<p>Most of you probably access webmail.mountunion.edu through a web browser like Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer. However, having a standalone <em>client</em> to handle your email will be a faster, and overall better, experience.</p>

<p>There are tens of email clients available for the Mac and PC, but I&rsquo;m just going to walk you through instructions setting up the default clients that come pre-installed on your machine. Macs have Mail.app, and PCs have Windows Mail.</p>

<h4>Mac Mail.app</h4>

<p>Setting up Mail.app is pretty straightforward. I&rsquo;m using OS X 10.8.2, so these instructions are for the latest version of Mail.app, but they should be the same for most cases.</p>

<pre><code>System Preferences.app &gt; Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars
</code></pre>

<p>Click on <code>Microsoft Exchange</code> and enter in your <code>Name</code>, full <code>Email Address</code> and <code>Password</code>. You may get a &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t verify the identity of the server&rdquo; popup, but just click <code>Continue</code> when it comes up.</p>

<p>Once it finds your account, click <code>Continue</code> and select the services you want set up. I usually uncheck all the boxes except for Mail and Contacts. Click <code>Add Account</code>. Go open up Mail.app and you should see your mail begin to download. Now whenever you want to check / write an email, just open Mail.app.</p>

<h4>Windows Mail</h4>

<p>Setting up Windows Mail is slightly less straightforward, you need the Reference Instructions from above, but it&rsquo;s pretty easy nonetheless. If this is your first time opening Windows Mail, I suggest this <a href="https://wiki.sonic.net/wiki/Windows_Mail_IMAP_Settings">excellent tutorial from Sonic.net</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Windows Mail &gt; Tools menu &gt; Accounts
</code></pre>

<p>Click <code>Add</code>, and then select <code>E-mail Account</code> as the type of account you wish to add. Click <code>Next</code>. Use the information from the Reference Instructions above to complete the setup. Make sure to use IMAP server setting for your <code>Incoming mail</code> and the SMTP server settings for <code>Outgoing e-mail</code>.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to test these instructions, however in addition to the Sonic.net tutorial, I also found the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Mail-setting-up-an-account-from-start-to-finish">official Microsoft instructions</a>.</p>

<h3>General IMAP and POP clients</h3>

<p>Enter the Reference instruction information from above. For specific instructions, I recommend that you head to Google. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=imap+setup+for+myclient">already created a search for you</a>, just replace &ldquo;myclient&rdquo; with the name of the application you are trying to set up.</p>

<h4>iOS Passcode-less email</h4>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure you have your Wi-Fi turned OFF before doing the following steps. You can turn off Wi-Fi by going to Settings.app.</p>

<pre><code>Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account...
</code></pre>

<p>Select <code>Other</code> from the bottom of the list, then choose to <code>Add Mail Account</code>. Here, enter you <code>Name</code>, <code>Email</code> and <code>Password</code> - just choose something like &ldquo;School&rdquo; for the <code>Description</code>.</p>

<p>Under &ldquo;Incoming Mail Server&rdquo;, enter <code>pod51008.outlook.com</code> as the <code>Host Name</code>, and enter your <strong>full</strong> @mountunion.edu email address under <code>User Name</code>. Do the exact same thing for &ldquo;Outgoing Mail Server&rdquo; as well.</p>

<p>Your mail should now work. Remove the old Mount Union account, and feel free to turn OFF your Passcode lock.</p>

<h4>Android Passcode-less email</h4>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tested the Android set up, but <a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/email/mobile/android-imap.html">this tutorial from UCSanDiego</a> has great pictures and instructions for setting up IMAP on Android.</p>

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>

<p>Hopefully one of the above instructions worked for you. If not, I&rsquo;d recommend taking your email client and laptop / phone / tablet down to Mount&rsquo;s IT department and having them set it up for you. If you have any comments, corrections or questions, feel free to <a href="/colophon">shoot me an email</a>. Cheers, everyone.</p>
