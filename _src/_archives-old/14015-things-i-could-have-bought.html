		<p>As I sat here <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/423184317494603776">debating which RSS syncing service to invest in</a>, a familiar tug on my conscience appeared. Do I really need this service? What problem does it solve? Could $18 be better spent?</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, God&rsquo;s been asking me these types of questions, and I&rsquo;ve done my best to avoid listening. But tonight, inspired in part by my soon-to-be sister-in-law&rsquo;s <a href="http://lifeloveandwords.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/a-year-of-nothing-new/">yearlong hiatus from buying anything nonessential</a>, I finally stopped avoiding His queries. After some reflection, I&rsquo;ve decided to take six months off from buying anything digital. Specifically, &ldquo;digital&rdquo; can refer to: apps, online subscriptions, music, and domain names &mdash; I&rsquo;ll add more to this list as I find them.</p>

<p>How many books on my desk still remain unread? Do I ever <em>really</em> become proficient with a an app if I switch every couple weeks? Which of the last few domains I purchased have I actually used? These are all questions that I want to stop feeling embarrassed about when answering, and the best means to that end is to put a hold on adding to the problem.</p>

<p>This might sound unorthodox for a writer who focuses on some of the very things he&rsquo;s giving up, but I&rsquo;ve found that listening to the small questions from God can return the biggest rewards. If you want to follow me in this challenge, bookmark this page; I&rsquo;ll be updating it with the price and name of anything that I get the inclination to buy. I&rsquo;m curious how high the total savings get come July 15th.</p>

<p><strong>Total saved: $48.00</strong></p>
