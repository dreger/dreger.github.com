		<p><a href="http://inessential.com">Brent Simmons</a>, a Mac and iOS developer, recently received an email from his domain registrar, Network Solutions, informing him that his account <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/01/21/network_solutions_auto-enroll_1_850">had been automatically enrolled into a new security program</a>, WebLock, and that his credit card would &ldquo;be billed $1,850 for the first year of service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Read that again. A company opted-in a customer to a program that costs over $1,500 a year, and they only informed him after the deed was done.</p>

<p>Utterly appalling.</p>
