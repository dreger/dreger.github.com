		<p>Exams are now over and so <a href="/archives/13340-exams.html">is my hiatus</a>. Although I had limited time to read anything other than my notes from class, I saved several articles that I found particularly interesting and worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>CNN</em> put out a great photo set of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/world/gallery/most-beautiful-libraries-in-the-world">the worlds most exquisite libraries</a>,&rdquo; and the images are incredible. There are many places I&rsquo;d love to visit in this world, but these libraries just jumped to the top of my list.</li>
<li>Arina Pozdnyak, a graphic designer from Russia, has created the first calendar I&rsquo;d ever consider hanging on a wall. Called the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Perpetual-Calendar/11908945">Perpetual Calendar</a>,&rdquo; each month features a beautiful landscape with the month name set in the ultralight weight of Helvetica Neue. Fantastic.</li>
<li>Maria O'Connell, writing for Whittaker Associates&rsquo;s blog, wrote a piece called &ldquo;<a href="http://whittakerassociates.com/not-just-coffee-starbucks%E2%80%99-rise-to-success/">Not Just Coffee: Starbuck' Rise to Success</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a great read, particularly over a cup of coffee, and I finally got the answer to a question I had as to why round tables are so prevalent in Starbucks:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>The round tables in a Starbucks store were strategically created in an effort to protect self-esteem for those coffee-drinkers flying solo. After all, there are no “empty” seats at a round table. Service counters are built out of natural materials like warm woods and stone, rather than plastics and metals, to create a homier atmosphere.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Toby Osbourn, a developer working at Buffer (that social media app), wrote about <a href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/12/productivity/the-problems-i-am-facing-with-being-able-to-work-whenever-i-want/">some of the challenges of working remotely</a>. Although I&rsquo;m incredibly fond of remote work as an alternative to the normal 9-5 work day, there have been a lack of first-hand discussions surrounding the growing pains of moving to a remote work style.</li>
<li>Nick Heer, my online buddy who writes over at <em><a href="http://pxlnvy.com">Pixel Envy</a></em>, tweeted a link to an interesting art project he worked on called &ldquo;Departures.&rdquo; As a web designer, most of what I see that constitutes &ldquo;art&rdquo; is digital, made of pixels and only visible on a screen connected to the internet. So when I see something real-world and tangible made by someone I know primarily by their online work, I feel it deserves some attention.</li>
<li>Gretchen Reynolds, for <em>The New York Times</em> &ldquo;Well&rdquo; health and fitness blog, <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/why-a-brisk-walk-is-better/">wrote a groundbreaking piece</a>, revealing that the faster you walk the more healthy you probably are. <em>Note: The same holds true for exercise in general; the more you exercise, the more healthy you probably are. Same for food; the better you eat, the more healthy you probably are.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>I hope everyone&rsquo;s had a great start to December, and, as always, thanks for reading.</p>
