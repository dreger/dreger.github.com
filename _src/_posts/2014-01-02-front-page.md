The front page of a site is the first impression that a visitor gets. I've been toying with two different layouts for my website: 

1. List all the posts. Clicking on the post title will take the reader to a clean, easy-to-read view where they can then navigate back to the front page. 
2. List the latest 10-20 posts with full-text included. Clicking on a post title will still take the reader to an individual page, but the homepage becomes much more engaging on first look. 

I find the number two is the far more popular option for blogs and websites of my nature (news, commentary), probably because it takes less clicks for the visitor to immediately start reading. Other sites use a hybrid of the two options and only include post _excerpts_ instead of the full body text. My issue with this layout is that not all my posts are designed to have an excerpt ripped out, and I've never liked a generic take-the-first-paragraph-as-excerpt method &mdash; particularly if you have an introductory sentence followed by a blockquote. 

I feel the answer comes down to who you think your readers are. If they're the type of reader who appreciates reading, taking control of that experience will ensure a good experience. However, if your reader is used to short, quick-reads, a front page that facilitates that reading is preferable. 

Now the kicker: what type of readers do you want? 

If you're like me &mdash; relatively obscure on the writing scene &mdash; the way you structure your front page will in some way curb the type of readers that you acquire. Although I do plan on posting shorter pieces that add commentary to articles elsewhere, I want to primarily be writing posts of substance. I want my readers to be interested in long-form reading, so I'm going to use a design that encourages that. If you've never heard of [The Slow Web](http://jackcheng.com/the-slow-web), it's an essay on the timely and real-time nature of the web. From the article: 

> Timely not real-time. Rhythm not random. Moderation not excess. Knowledge not information. These are a few of the many characteristics of the Slow Web. Itâ€™s not so much a checklist as a feeling, one of being at greater ease with the web-enabled products and services in our lives.

Although Cheng's focus here is the companies who "want us to spend every moment of our waking lives with them," the sentiments of what he's saying (quality experiences, moderation) can be applicable to a news-based website as well. That's why I've gone with the list-baseed approach for the front page of this site.
