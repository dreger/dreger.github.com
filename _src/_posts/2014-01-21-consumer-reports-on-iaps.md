In the wake of Apple's refund of $32.5 million to the parents of kids who had made unsupervised in-app purchases, Consumer Reports highlights just how easy it is to spend money on frivelous bits. 

> In its complaint against Apple, the FTC noted that one parent of a young Apple user reported that her daughter had spent $2,600 in the Tap Pet Hotel game from Pocket Gems. So I installed the Android version of that game on an Android tablet by downloading it free from the Google Play Store. Having previously enabled the store’s password protection feature (using the Google Play app’s Settings), I approved one in-app purchase of a Bunch of Treats for 99 cents, just as any soft-hearted parent might do. [...]


> Morphing from Doting Dad to mischievous child, I then entered the Pet Hotel unsupervised, where I spent the next 30 minutes making seven more 99 cent in-app purchases of Treats or Coins, all without any further authorization. Just tap and spend. (Sometime during that period I indulged in a spontaneous detour from the game to the Play Store and tacked on an unauthorized purchase of an unrelated app for $2.99—just because I could.) Total cost of my spending spree: $9.92.
