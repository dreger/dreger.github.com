If you've recently upgraded to OS X Mavericks and found that Mail.app was a doing an increasingly-poor job at managing your mail, I encourage you to go download this patch from Apple which fixes those issues.

Between the popularity of Gmail and Mail.app being a core OS X application, I really can't believe they didn't catch these issues in the beta releases.
