Exams are now over and so [is my hiatus]({% post_url archives/2013-12-06-exams %}). Although I had limited time to read anything other than my notes from class, I saved several articles that I found particularly interesting and worth mentioning: 

- _CNN_ put out a great photo set of "[the worlds most exquisite libraries](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/world/gallery/most-beautiful-libraries-in-the-world)," and the images are incredible. There are many places I'd love to visit in this world, but these libraries just jumped to the top of my list. 
- Arina Pozdnyak, a graphic designer from Russia, has created the first calendar I'd ever consider hanging on a wall. Called the "[Perpetual Calendar](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Perpetual-Calendar/11908945)," each month features a beautiful landscape with the month name set in the ultralight weight of Helvetica Neue. Fantastic. 
- Maria O'Connell, writing for Whittaker Associates's blog, wrote a piece called "[Not Just Coffee: Starbuck' Rise to Success](http://whittakerassociates.com/not-just-coffee-starbucks%E2%80%99-rise-to-success/)." It's a great read, particularly over a cup of coffee, and I finally got the answer to a question I had as to why round tables are so prevalent in Starbucks: 

> The round tables in a Starbucks store were strategically created in an effort to protect self-esteem for those coffee-drinkers flying solo. After all, there are no “empty” seats at a round table. Service counters are built out of natural materials like warm woods and stone, rather than plastics and metals, to create a homier atmosphere.

- Toby Osbourn, a developer working at Buffer (that social media app), wrote about [some of the challenges of working remotely](http://tosbourn.com/2013/12/productivity/the-problems-i-am-facing-with-being-able-to-work-whenever-i-want/). Although I'm incredibly fond of remote work as an alternative to the normal 9-5 work day, there have been a lack of first-hand discussions surrounding the growing pains of moving to a remote work style. 
- Nick Heer, my online buddy who writes over at _[Pixel Envy](http://pxlnvy.com)_, tweeted a link to an interesting art project he worked on called "Departures." As a web designer, most of what I see that constitutes "art" is digital, made of pixels and only visible on a screen connected to the internet. So when I see something real-world and tangible made by someone I know primarily by their online work, I feel it deserves some attention. 
- Gretchen Reynolds, for _The New York Times_ "Well" health and fitness blog, [wrote a groundbreaking piece](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/why-a-brisk-walk-is-better/), revealing that the faster you walk the more healthy you probably are. _Note: The same holds true for exercise in general; the more you exercise, the more healthy you probably are. Same for food; the better you eat, the more healthy you probably are._  

I hope everyone's had a great start to December, and, as always, thanks for reading.
