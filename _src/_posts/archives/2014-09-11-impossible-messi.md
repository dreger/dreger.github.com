If you love football, statistics, and graphs, do I have something for you. Benjamin Morris, writing for _FiveThirtyEight_, [analyzes the astonishing career, and numbers, of Lionel Messi](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lionel-messi-is-impossible/):

> In other words, if Barca-Messi and Argentina-Messi were two different people, even based solely on the stats recorded since 2010, there’s a good chance they’d be the two best players in the world.

Not enough? [Proof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0gS5CshUDE), [proof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiPaXx9flLk), and [more (albeit annoying music) proof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K9UmbqdBq8).

_Extra credit: I love whenever Messi's playing and [Ray Hudson is commentating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQaxme_Sug)_.
