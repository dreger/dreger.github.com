[Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com/blog/from-the-porch-to-the-street/):

> Here’s the frustration: if you’ve been on Twitter a while, it’s changed out from under you. Christopher Alexander made a great diagram, a spectrum of privacy: street to sidewalk to porch to living room to bedroom. I think for many of us Twitter started as the porch—our space, our friends, with the occasional neighborhood passer-by. As the service grew and we gained followers, we slid across the spectrum of privacy into the street.

For about two years, I was on Twitter before any of my friends were; Twitter was always a public space to me. I enjoy using Twitter, more for reading than tweeting, but that is because I keep the number of accounts I follow (currently 90) to a minimum. I don't know how some people manage to follow hundreds &mdash; some, thousands &mdash; of other people.
