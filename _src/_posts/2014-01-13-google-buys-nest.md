Google announced today that they had just [paid $3.2 billion in cash](http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html) to acquire Nest, the makers of those [gorgeous thermostats]({% post_url 2013-10-08-the-nest-protect %}) and smoke detectors. This acquisition is interesting for two reasons: 

1. Tony Fadell, Nest CEO and ex-Senior Vice President of the iPod Division at Apple, now works for Google. 
2. Google now has a hand in the personal home safety game. 

My gut reaction is that Google is looking for new ways into the home, and buying Nest was a great way to open the door. If Nest could make thermostats look svelte and sexy, what other boring home appliances have they been wanting to reimagine, but couldn't afford to build? Given Nest's other products, my money's on them going after door locks, power outlets, or something in the kitchen.
