_The New York Times_ writing about Twitter's recent filing to become publicly-traded on the stock market:

> The social network disclosed that it plans to use the ticker symbol "TWTR," but didn't specify a stock exchange. It also listed a $1 billion fund-raising target, a pro forma number meant to calculate listing fees.

Huge day for a company that collects less-than 140 character snippets of text.
Nearly a year-and-a-half ago, Facebook held its own IPO and [raised $16 billion](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/facebook-raises-16-billion-in-i-p-o/) on opening day.
