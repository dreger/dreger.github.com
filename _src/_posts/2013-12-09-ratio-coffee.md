It might not be a well-known fact about me, but I love coffee. Not just any coffee, however, but good coffee. And a small spoiler for you, but good coffee doesn't come in any container with the name "Folgers" or "Maxwell" on it. 

Coffee and I go hand-in-hand during exam week. 

> Ratio is the result of pondering coffee makers for several years. After listening to many customers complain about flimsy plastic parts, complicated programming steps, and overall inelegance, I decided to draw together a team of talented designers, engineers, and creatives to build a new company that is devoted entirely to coffee machines of unmatched beauty and quality.
