All through high school, I used an electric razor to manage the spotty, Irish-driven facial hair that besets my face whenever I let it go for a more than a few days. The shave was fine, razor burn was often, and I didn't care. I was in high school. 

Then college hit, and my facial hair decided to accelerate its growth. 

It was at this point in time that I realized two things about myself: 

1. I like having a clean shaven face. 
2. I dislike razor burn. 

Given the increased frequency of my shaving, the burn was becoming annoying. Disposable razors ws seomthing that I had looked into
