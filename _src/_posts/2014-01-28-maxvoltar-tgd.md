Tina Essmaker just [published her interview with Dropbox designer, Tim Van Damme](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/tim-van-damme).

I have followed the work of Van Damme, _maxvoltar_, for at least the past five years. The Great Discontent has an archives full of great creative people, but Van Damme's interview was incredibly honest and humble. Van Damme: 

> Young people want everything immediately, but it takes time. What I love about our industry is that it doesn’t matter what kind of degree you have: you have to show up and show people what you can do. There’s no bullshitting yourself through an interview process. You have to work really hard for it, and there’s an honesty to it that I love.

I think I loved this interview so much was because it showed me how many parallels there are between Van Damme's perspective and me. And if those parallels exist, maybe I could accomplish similar in my lifetime.
