*Update: this post was written over on a Wordpress blog I had during the summer. Although I migrated most of the posts to my current setup, some are written with the implication that they're still over there - silly things.*

I'm just going to warn you, this will probably be a little rough for the first couple weeks. I typically write longer, thought-out posts over on [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com/), and never felt that short entries should fill the archives. Here, however, the game's changed. I want to get better at writing on a smaller scale, not just when I have 1,500 words in [iA Writer](http://iawriter.com/).

I'm trying to build a habit. Habits are built day by day, week by week, and more often than not, they don't stick. Consistency is one of the only ways to ensure a habit has time to take root in your life and grow. I can tell some days are going to be like pulling teeth to get up and write, but I need to. If I do, I'll eventually become a better writer and it won't be as difficult.
