A fantastic new app by Nicholas Feltron, the guy behind _[The 2012 Feltron Annual Report](http://feltron.com/ar12_01.html)_ (an incredibly detailed self analysis), Reporter for iPhone is a data-collecting tool that helps you track quantifiable data about your life. From the pre-launch page:

> Reporter is a new application for tracking the things you care about. With a few randomly timed surveys each day, Reporter can illuminate aspects of your life that might be otherwise unmeasurable.

The random surveys throughout the day are the most interesting part of this whole app.

Really great new app (not yet released) by Nicholas Feltron,

Vanessa Jeswani writing about Nicholas Feltron's personal data collecting for _Digital Lab_ back in April:

> Felton began his project 8 years ago when he realized he had recorded all the meals he ate with friends. As he began to collect more and more data on his activities, he recognized he needed an easy way to keep track of them, trying out iCal notes to internet surveys. This past year, he finally developed an iPhone app called Reporter that would simplify the life recording process. Every 90 minutes the app buzzed Felton to ask him: Where are you? Who are you with? What are you wearing? How productive were you today?
