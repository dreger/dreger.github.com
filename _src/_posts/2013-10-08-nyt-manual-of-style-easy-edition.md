One of the first things I  did to help turn [kyledreger.com into a web column]({% post_url 2013-09-02-jumping-in %}) was to develop a style guide for the site. A style guide is useful on many levels, the most basic being that it keeps an author's writing consistent from piece to piece. Capitalization, punctuation, and a plethora of other grammatical choices are always represented the same way, which not only fosters better writing, but better reading as well.

Actually creating a style guide from scratch is a little more difficult. sMost major publications today base their house style off of the [Associated Press's Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/); given it's widespread adoptment in journalism, AP is designed for the everyday news reader; decisisions of grammar and style on what the majority of readers will find the most clear. Although noble, I felt that my readers deserved something a little better; something a cut about. After doing a little more research, I felt confident that [_The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage_](http://www.amazon.com/York-Times-Manual-Style-Usage/dp/081296389X) was exactly what I wanted.

After using _The Times's_ Manual of Style for the past few weeks, I can say it's been fantastic. I keep a hard copy on my desk for reference.

One of my only complaints with choosing _The Times_ as a style guide is their lack of an online version. Compare that with [AP],


When I decided to take writing for this site , one of the first resources I got was a copy of [_The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage_](http://www.amazon.com/York-Times-Manual-Style-Usage/dp/081296389X). Although I'm still working on my own voice, making sure that I represent my writing in a consistent fashion is key to succeeding.

One of the reasons I choose _The New York Times's_ Manual of Style over, say, AP's is because of two reasons:

- I feel that it maintains the clarity that AP style strives for without giving up too much power.


Writing every day is hard. However, although it's gotten easier over the past few weeks, something that posed a problem was keeping my style of writing consistent.

One of the things you encounter when writing a lot is the issue of consistency. Punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and other grammatical issues are easy to deal with, but ensuring that everyone is using the same style is difficult to manage.

This is why publications like _The New York Times_ have in-house style guides. These guides are packed full of the "correct" usages for varying grammatical concepts.
