Benjamin Clymer for _HODINKEE_, in an interview with John Mayer:

> John is as serious a watch lover as anyone I've ever met. In fact, he's downright obsessive. And while Patek and Rolex might dominate his internal narrative these days, he loves all watches, from top to bottom.

I love my $25 Timex &mdash; not _quite_ a $30,000 Rolex &mdash; but while watching Mayer talk about his favorite watches, it becomes at once clear that the price of each one is insignificant to him; it's the story and the memories he has with each one that drives him to collect. True collecting at its finest.
