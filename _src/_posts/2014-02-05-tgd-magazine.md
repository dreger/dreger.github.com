I have long been a fan of [The Great Discontent](http://thegreatdiscontent.com) (TGD). Run by Tina and Ryan Essmaker, TGD has spent the last two years creating some of the best interviews with design professionals I've seen on the web. Their archive is packed with over [117 interviews](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/archive), featuring many of my personal design heroes like [Frank Chimero](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/frank-chimero), [Kyle Steed](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/kyle-steed), [Noah Stokes](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/noah-stokes), [Rogie King](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/rogie-king), the always-great [Trent Walton](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/trent-walton), and, as I linked-to earlier this month, [Tim Van Damme]({{ post_url 2014-01-28-maxvoltar-tgd }}).

However, TGD's latest post is not an interview, but an announcement. Both Ryan and Tina will be [taking The Great Discontent full-time](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/tgd-takes-the-leap).
