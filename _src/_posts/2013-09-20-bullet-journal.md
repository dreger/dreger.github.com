Developed by Ryder Carroll, an Art Director living in Brooklyn NY, the Bullet Journal is a note-taking system that focuses on helping you quickly collect and find all your daily todos and notes. I've been using it for the past few months and have found it to be a very personal, elegant way of organizing my daily life. 

The system also works amazingly well for school notebooks; the idea of numbering all your pages and keeping an index at the beginning of each notebook has fundamentaly changed the way I use take class notes. 

If you want just one reason to check out the Bullet Journal, this is it: your notes only become more organized over time, not less.
