Quietly shipped alongside all that was released on Tuesday, iOS 7.0.3 is now available for download.

In addition to iCloud Keychain, which lets you sync your passwords between iOS devices, Apple has also addressed complaints regarding the system-wide parallax effects. Federico Viticci for _MacStories_:

> Apple has listened, and in iOS 7.0.3 the Reduce Motion setting (available in General > Accessibility) now truly reduces animations: switching to apps and back to Home screen, unlocking the device, and moving between folders is now a cross-fade that is much faster than Appleâ€™s animations with Reduce Motion turned off.

Thank goodness. Although I really liked iOS 7, those transitions were time consuming and felt unnecessary. The cross-fade effect could be quicker still, but it's a huge improvement from before.
