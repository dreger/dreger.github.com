New math-based iOS game from the creators of [Ridiculous Fishing](http://www.ridiculousfishing.com), [Greg Wohlwend](http://aeiowu.com) and [Asher Vollmer](http://ashervollmer.tumblr.com/home). Blending math and strategy, Threes! looks incredibly addicting. If you are more of a visual person, I found [the trailer](http://asherv.com/threes/) does a great job of explaining the gameplay.

Andrew Webster, writing [for _The Verge_](http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/6/5361708/threes-ipad-iphone-puzzle-game):

> Your time in Threes is really only spent doing one thing — adding numbers together to make bigger ones. Yet it remains constantly engaging despite its seemingly simplistic nature. It may be about numbers, but Threes is really a strategy game at heart. In order to get the really big numbers — the ones you'll need to inflate your high score and pose a challenge on the online leaderboards — you'll need to plan at least a few moves ahead.

Also interesting to read, Ben Kuchera, over on Polygon, has the backstory to Threes! and why it took [over a year to develop](http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5386200/why-it-took-a-year-to-make-and-then-break-down-an-amazing-puzzle-game):

> They kept trying to add new concepts, new themes and, in some cases, new mechanics. These ideas might have been interesting, but they hid what made the game fun; the simple act of matching numbers in multiples of threes.

> "Every time I added anything like that, it always felt unwieldy and unnatural. It just didn’t want to be there," Vollmer explained. "Every time I took that stuff out it felt like a good game again."

Threes! is, cutely, 33.333333% off for a limited time, which puts it [at only $1.99 on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8). If you like puzzle games in the same vein as [Letterpress](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/) and [SpellTower](http://www.spelltower.com), I have a feeling you are in for a treat.
