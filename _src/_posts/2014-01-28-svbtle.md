Dustin Curtis has opened up the registration for his blogging platform, Svbtle: 

> Svbtle is designed to highlight the things that matter; it’s an extremely simple platform for collecting and developing ideas, sharing them with the world, and reading them. That’s it. We’ve focused all of our energy into designing the simplest interface possible for accomplishing these goals. Svbtle is blogging with everything else stripped away.

But what really is Svbtle? Ironically, my International Politics 101 class may be able to help me here. In IP101, we studied how international leaders can estimate what the next move, or plan, of other leaders will be. There are several ways of doing this, but the methods that are applicable to Svbtle are to look at how Curtis thinks, and then look at the past decisions Svbtle has made. 

### Timeline:

- Curtis blogs about "[Codename: Svbtle](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle)"
- Svbtle opens as invite-only
- "Big names" of the industry start writing for the service
- Medium launches
- Svbtle gets undisclosed amount of funding
- Curtis removes all the articles he wrote on [dustincurtis.com](http://dustincurtis.com) and forwards requests to his Svbtle blog at [dcurt.is](http://dcurt.is). 


It has been about two years since Curtis first wrote about his new blogging platform
