Yesterday, Dustin Curtis opened up registration for his blogging platform, Svbtle: 

> Svbtle is designed to highlight the things that matter; it’s an extremely simple platform for collecting and developing ideas, sharing them with the world, and reading them. That’s it. We’ve focused all of our energy into designing the simplest interface possible for accomplishing these goals. Svbtle is blogging with everything else stripped away.

Svbtle now joins [Medium](http://medium.com) as a place to write online, with the hope pulling our narratives back into greater-than-140-character snippets. 

But what really are Svbtle and Medium? Both appear to be similar to Wordpress, the open-source blogging engine, but neither Svbtle nor Medium allow you to host your own instance of the code; everything lives on their servers. In addition, both Svbtle and Medium feature front pages that highlight recent posts from their members. Other differences include Svbtle's focus on identity (we will come back to that later) and Mediums emphasis on other pieces _not by the same author_. 

So what Svbtle and Medium? Are they digital magazines? 

Ironically, in my attempt to understand both these services, my International Politics 101 class has come in handy. In IP101, we studied how international leaders can estimate what the next move, or plan, of other leaders will be. There are several ways of doing this, but the methods that are applicable to Svbtle and Medium are to profile each service's leader (Svbtle : Dustin Curtis :: Medium : Ev Williams), and then analyze the history of decisions that each company has made and the perceived reason why. Hold on, we are about to do a lot of digging (and TechCrunch linking). 

### Overview of the Leaders

**Dustin Curtis**

- 

**Evan (Ev) Williams**

- Founded Blogger, [invented terms "blogging" and "blog"](http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804C&L=ADS-L&P=R16795&I=-3)
- Co-founded [Obvious Corp.](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/obvious)
- Co-founded Odeo, a podcasting company, in 2004, after Blogger was acquired by Google
- Co-founded Twitter in April 2007
- Launched Medium in August 2012

### Overall Timeline, Starting at the Beginning:

- **July 15, 2006**: [Obvious launches Twttr](http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/). All status updates to the service are public. 

- **End of 2008**: Curtis [launches Lifepath.me](http://dcurt.is/facebook-timelines-and-lifepath-me-4), a service that focuses on creating individual timelines of one's life. He later sells it for around $10,000. 

- **Mar 22, 2012**: Curtis first writes about his new blogging engine in "[Codename: Svbtle](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle)". Svbtle opens as an [invite-only network](http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/23/2897027/svbtle-dustin-curtis-obtvse-clone-open-source). The clean design attracts a lot of attention, particularly one small element called the Kudos button; a hover-to-activate Curtis [likes it](https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/164080493384577025) and [defends the button](http://dcurt.is/unkudo), calling it an "otherwise meaningless number". 
 
_Curtis on the design of Svbtle: "The goal is simple: when you see the Svbtle design, you should know that the content is guaranteed to be great. Network bloggers are encouraged to keep quality high at the expense of everything else."_

- **Aug 14, 2012**: Medium [launches in invite-only mode as well](http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2012/08/14/twitter-founders-preview-new-online-publishing-medium/). Users can sign up via their Twitter handles and "recommend" stories. 

- **Jan 8, 2013**: Svbtle receives a ["not insignificant" amount of seed funding](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/08/with-funding-for-svbtle-dustin-curtis-wants-to-build-a-business-in-long-form-online-content/). Curtis empasizes that the money is for building infrastrucutre, build great writing tools, and provide a cushion for experimentation. 

- **Mar 4, 2013**: Curtis [removes all his old articles from dustincurtis.com](http://www.quora.com/Dustin-Curtis-1/What-happened-to-the-articles-at-Dustincurtis-com/answer/Dustin-Curtis) and commits to using [dcurt.is](http://dcurt.is).  
 
- **Dec 4, 2013**: Medium redesigns with, what they call, "Medium 1.0," featuring full-bleed images, and more. 

- **Jan 28, 2014**: Medium receives $25 million in Series A funding

"Big names" of the industry start writing for the service
- Medium launches
- Svbtle gets undisclosed amount of funding
- Curtis removes all the articles he wrote on [dustincurtis.com](http://dustincurtis.com) and forwards requests to his Svbtle blog at [dcurt.is](http://dcurt.is). 


It has been about two years since Curtis first wrote about his new blogging platform

Svbtle will continue to focus on the author. 

Medium will continue to focus on the craft. 

Just like their leaders.
