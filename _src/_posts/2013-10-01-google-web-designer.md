It would be much more honest if they called it Google _Ad_ Designer. Google needed a way to help designers make HTML5-based advertisements, and this is their solution.

I understand wanting to help create good web ads, but I'm curious why Web Designer doesn't look like any of the company's other applications. Most of Google's recent designs have shared a consistent language, [as noted by](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016268/google-the-redesign) Farhad Manjoo of _Fast Company_:

> White space. Cards. Clean typography. And a simple, consistent interface to access Google's boundless power. These are the most recognizable elements in Google's new library of design elements--the main phrases in what the company calls its common design language.

White space? Clean typography? Just [look at it]({{site.domain}}/public/cargo/google-web-designer.png). There's no acknowledgment of these principles. I personally think it looks ugly, but then so do most web advertisements out there.
