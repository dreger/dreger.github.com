I've had a small cold, but I'm excited to be back with co-host Chris Durr (coming in from "on location" in Columbus). We discuss some follow-up to our [last episode together]({% post_url 2014-03-08-log-004-beakers-and-bits %}), ethanol power, Star Wars movie order, quantum computing, when our favorite shows "jumped the shark," and more.
