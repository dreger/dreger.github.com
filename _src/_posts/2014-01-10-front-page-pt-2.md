Following my post on [The Front Page](), I had a good email conversation with my buddy, Nick Heer. Our conversation brought up some other ideas, which I wanted to expand on. Consider this part of an ongoing, public discussion and exploration of rhetorical design.

__The sterile nature of an archive-as-front-page approach isn't ideal. This type of layout lends itself more to that of pure essayists (Paul Graham, for example), and, if updated frequently, it can obscure new content.__

One solution to this point could be to borrow from _Rands in Repose_ and have the latest article in full text, followed by a list of the complete archive. However, although this seems to fix the issue of identifying new content, I have an issue when the most recent post is lengthy. 

One of the benefits of my previously mentioned "conservative" design is that it allows the front page to double as the site's archive. When the most recent post is short, both the post and the list of archives remain visible, allowing the reader to quickly see the duality of purpose. However, when the latest post is long, the archive list is pushed far down the page, obscured from vision. And, unless the visitor scrolls all the way down, I've essentially hidden a key component of the site (the archive, which doesn't exist in the conventional navigation) on the only page it appears. 

__What is the role of timelessness in a news-focused website? Does highlighting the most recent article necessarily wreck this sentiment?__

I'm trying to create a design that accomplishes two things: 1.) allow for each post to However, when trying to design a news-based front page, there is a certain sense of "timelyness" that must be present. Listing just the archive of a site on the front page does this relatively well, because each post is on equal footing, and the weight of the first impression isn't resting on a single piece. The safety with the liberal design of listing 10-20 articles on the front page is safe, allowing the reader to gauge a cumulative opinion of the type of writing the author is doing. However, by limiting that exposure to a single post, you are limiting your first impression to whatever your latest post was about. 

__Is timelessness predicated on lacking a date?__

Your final question ("More specifically, is timelessness predicated on lacking a date?") got me thinking of a possible compromise of the two ideas: What if the front page were a list of titles, but the first (latest) post title had the date appended in an accent color. This would create a single point of focus to identify whether there was new content (assuming the reader remembers the date they were last there) and keep the archive list design.
