99% of what you create in life is [a remix](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) of someone else's work. Enjoy the fact you didn't have to start from scratch. Isacc Newton put it succinctly, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."

The design I've created here is a remix - one based on a decade's worth of inspiration from all corners of the web. Hat tips to [Signal vs. Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/), [Galen Gidman](http://galengidman.com), the [Svbtle Network](http://svbtle.com) and [Information Architects](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/) just to name a few.

How I approach tomorrow will be a remix of how I approached today - taking what I've learned in the past 24 hours to alter and refine my direction in life.

I love originality, but even I am a remix. I'm proud that my work builds on the foundations of others, and I'd be honoured if mine could do the same for someone else one day.
