In college, you find that a lot of people drink "coffee." They drink this "coffee" in an array of containers &mdash; from ceramic mugs to travel thermoses. However, this post is about what makes good coffee, and good coffee isn't something that you buy in a container with the name "Maxwell" or "Folgers." No, this is about what goes into good coffee, and how you can get some of it for yourself.
