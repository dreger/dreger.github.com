Kirsty Parkin, [writing over on CGSociety.org][ikea]: 

> Today, around 75% of all IKEA’s product images are CG, and they have a ‘bank’ of about 25,000 models. "These are all created at a ridiculously high resolution," explains Martin, "We render them in 4Kx4K, and they need to hold up to that resolution. We need to be able to do whatever we like with the renderings - print them on large walls in the stores if we need to. Even if most of them are only ever used on the website, they all have the capability to be printed very high-res."


> The first entire room image to be created in CG for one of IKEA’s catalogues was in 2010. "There were a LOT of people involved in that image,” says Martin. “As you can imagine, the first time you do something, everyone wants to have a look! But then the catalogue after that had four or five images and it really took off."
