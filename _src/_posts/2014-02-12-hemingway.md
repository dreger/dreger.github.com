[Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com), developed by Adam and Ben Long, is a small website where you can have your text analyzed against a variety of clarity-focused metrics. From the home page: 

> Hemingway highlights long, complex sentences and common errors; if you see a yellow highlight, shorten the sentence or split it. If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic â€” try editing this sentence to remove the red.

Although the syntax parser could use some tweaking (and Markdown support for that matter), I personally liked Hemingway's presentation of "sentence syntax" over that of [Information Architect's Writer Pro]({% post_url 2013-12-19-writer-pro-for-mac %}). 

Hemingway, as the name implies, tries to enforce a very bold and clear writing style, emblematic of [Ernest Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway). I personally enjoy this style of writing; however, as new syntax- and grammar-focused tools start to appear, it is important to remember that there are no true _hard_ rules of grammar. You can break any of these "rules" you want, just be sure to do so with purpose.
