Cal Newport writing for his blog, [Study Hacks](http://calnewport.com/blog):

> The courage culture paints a tempting picture of how people end up with remarkable lives. It tells a story where you're the main character, fighting evil forces, and ultimately triumphing after a brief but intense battle.

> The reality is decidedly less exciting. Remarkable careers require that you become remarkably good. This takes time. But not necessarily a string of defiant rejections of some mysterious status quo.

As we all prepare to go on to whatever's "next" in our life, it's important to remember that success isn't always hinged on bravely just "going for it"; it also encompasses putting in the effort to become **great** at what we do.
