This news broke yesterday afternoon, but I wanted to let it simmer for a while before commenting. Given that [Hoefler & Frere-Jones (H&FJ)](http://www.typography.com) is one of the world's best type foundries (their fonts in use by Nike, the Obama campaign, and numerous other national agencies), I wasn't sure whether the headlines about one of the founders suing the other were simply sensational and overreacting to something much smaller. 

I was wrong. 

If you read the [actual NYC claims document](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=ydQwzs4EZjDkplRrBmkkwA==&system=prod), it becomes immediately clear that Hoefler intentionally broke his promise of giving Frere-Jones a 50% stake in the company. From the claims document (emphasis mine), starting with #13: 

> 13 . The heart of the proposal was that __Frere-Jones would contribute his name, reputation, industry connections and design authority__, as well as obtain and assign to HTF the rights to certain fonts he had already developed at Font Bureau (referred to as the "Dowry Fonts") __in exchange for half of the equity in Hoefler's existing business, HTF__.

> 14 . A critical part of the creation of the new partnership was that Frere-Jones would "have his name on the door."

One world-class type designer and one savvy businessman, who were friends, going into business together makes perfect sense. However, things get shady when we skip down to #29: 

> 29 . After he signed the Sale and Assignment of Type Fonts, __Frere-Jones repeatedly asked Hoefler to complete his part of the bargain and transfer half of the ownership in HTF to him__, and Hoefler repeatedly acknowledged his obligation to do so, but each time begged off purportedly due to the pressures of work or his personal life. As a good partner, Frere-Jones respected Hoefler's wishes.

The most incriminating sections finish with #42-43: 

> 42 . On October 21, 2013, for the first time, Hoefler explicitly reneged on his personal agreement to transfer 50% of HTF to Frere-Jones.

> 43 . Upon information and belief, __Hoefler transferred to his wife, Borsella, the shares that he had promised to Frere-Jones__ and Hoefler and Borsella are now the owners of 100% of HTF.

Essentially, Hoefler knowingly used Frere-Jones' reputation, connections, and fonts, without any intention of giving Frere-Jones his 50% of the company. Magnifying the problem, according to #42, Hoefler gave what was supposed to be Frere-Jones' stake to Mrs. Hoefler, letting the Hoeflers own 100% of Hoefler & Frere-Jones. 

[Designers across the web](https://news.layervault.com/stories/13141-tobias-frerejones-is-suing-jonathan-hoefler-for-being-denied-a-50-stake-in-their-business) are concerned, not only for the fate of the preeminent type foundry, but also for the company's latest product: [Cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/); a way to use H&FJ's fonts on websites. 

And, according to #49 in the claims document, there is real reason to be concerned: 

> 49 . Frere-Jones has suffered damage from the breach in an amount to be determined at trial __but not less than $20 million__.

In a legal situation similar to that when Eduardo Saverin sued Mark Zuckerberg over Saverin's share in Facebook, it's not a stretch to say that nothing good happens when friends sue each other for millions of dollars.
