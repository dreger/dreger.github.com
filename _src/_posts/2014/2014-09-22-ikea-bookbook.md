Ikea, six days before Apple's September event, released a clever, short video, introducing the Ikea bookbook. From the video description:

> At only 8mm thin, and weighing in at less than 400g, the 2015 IKEA Catalogue comes pre-installed with thousands of home furnishing ideas.

Fun, and in good taste.

To be fair, the iPhone 6 and 6+ [are thinner](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/) than the bookbook; however, not even Apple's best can beat that bookbook's battery life and built-in security features.
