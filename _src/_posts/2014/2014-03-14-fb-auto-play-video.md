Emil Protalinski, [writing for _The Next Web_](http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/03/13/facebook-introduces-15-second-premium-video-ads-auto-play-without-sound-stop-scroll-past): 

> Facebook today [introduced](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Premium-Video-Ads-on-Facebook) 15-second video ads, which will start playing without sound as they appear on screen and stop if you scroll past. If you tap the video, it will expand into a full-screen view with sound. The company says users can expect to start seeing these new ads "over the next few months."

Facebook is not the first to bring auto-play videos to mobile devices &mdash; both Instagram and Vine did the same last year. However, I don't like this trend where companies automatically download videos over a cellular data connection, eating through our monthly data caps. All of the aforementioned apps give options to disable auto-play when not on Wi-Fi, but that setting should be what we have to _opt-out_ of, not opt-in to.
