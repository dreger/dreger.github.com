Mark Hearn, writing for 9to5Google: 

> During its Atmosphere Live event, Google’s Sundar Pichai announced that the company’s Drive cloud storage platform has over 240 million active users, up 190 from million since June. The Google executive also revealed that Chromebooks are largest selling EDU device in the US approaching a 50 percent share compared to 5 percent 18 months ago.

I don't doubt that Chromebooks are selling well; they're cheap and meet the web-based needs of most students. But I'm wondering what counts as a "device." Is the iPad included here?
