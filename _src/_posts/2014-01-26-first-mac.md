The Macintosh I use now is a mid-2013 13-inch Macbook Air. 

Apple's question about what your first Mac was got me thinking about my own. 

My first laptop was an old Thinkpad notebook, given to me by my uncle. It ran Windows 95, and 

My first _actual_ encounter with a Mac was in middle school. I was over at my aunt's house, and she had brought her iBook (for work) back with her. I asked if it was alright for me to use it, and she turned it on and logged me in. I don't remember much about what I did, but I do remember seeing the way the Menu bar worked, the way it was a persistent, actionable menu, and thinking "this is how computers should work." 

After my encounter with the smelly white iBook, I knew that I wanted to get a Mac.
