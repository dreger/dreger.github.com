This week, Christopher Durr, an inorganic chemistry student and my soon-to-be brother-in-law, joins me for a relaxed talk about science and nerdery. Topics discussed: why my phone won't have 24-hour battery any time soon; the merits to the imperial system; eliminating time zones; chess; and some of our favorite apps.
