![coffeescript](http://dregerkq.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20120526-012316.jpg?w=640)

Today, I learned about CoffeeScript.

CoffeeScript is one part of the three part formula I'm looking to learn more about. The other two parts are Ruby on Rails and Spine.js. Part of this inspiration comes from [@destroytoday](http://twitter.com/destroytoday) and his venture into this area of web app development. I really admire his work and his tweets on the subject have been really helpful to point me in the right direction.

So CoffeeScript, what is it? CoffeeScript is, as they put it:

> a little language that compiles into JavaScript.

Really simple. If you go to their website at [coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org/), you can see some really cool demos of how CoffeeScript makes writing JavaScript much more fun. It takes a little bit of the Ruby style syntax (indentation and lack of semi-colons) and applies it to writing JavaScript.

I just started getting into the tutorials, but I've found that “[The Little Book on CoffeeScript](http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/)” to be a great place to start.
