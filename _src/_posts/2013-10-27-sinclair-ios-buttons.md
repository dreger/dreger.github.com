iOS app designer and devloper, Jared Sinclair:

> iOS 7's designers have abandoned bordered buttons in favor of borderless colored text. I think this choice is unjustifiable. It is the root cause of my deep dislike for how it feels to use iOS 7. It introduces unnecessary tension and makes everything less usable than it ought to be.

Sinclair, who works on the excellent App.net client [Riposte](http://riposteapp.net), raises some valid points about iOS 7's usability.
