One of the ways that I chronicle my life is through the action of journaling. However, I don't always have time to sit down and write out long reflections on the day. Back when I was a young boy, I used to carry around little steno notebooks and write about my day _as it was happening_.

I still carry around [little notebooks](http://fieldnotesbrand.com), but I've long since moved all my journaling to the digital realm. My app of choice to help manage the 78,857 words I've written over the past four years has been Day One by [Bloom Built](http://dayoneapp.com).

Now, Day One has been fully updated for iOS 7, and includes some great new features to take advantage of the iPhone 5S's M7 processor. I'm really excited about the new visual look, but what's even better is that the core formula that makes Day One great hasn't changed.
