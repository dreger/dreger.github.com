title: College take two
---

Really excited to be moving back to Mount Union. I'm looking forward to get back into the swing of college life and return to soccer with our team.

When I look back at the beginning of my freshman year, I can't believe how much I've grown since then. I have a million times more confidence, an amazing, supportive girlfriend and my brother will make for an awesome roommate.

I've got a lot of goals for this year, but I'm keeping my mind open to be directed by whatever He calls me to do. When big life changes come along like this, I always come back to one of my favorite quotes:

>Expect the unexpected and, whenever possible, be the unexpected.

Ready. Packed. Let's go.
