It's now been nearly a year and a half since I first received my [GORUCK GR1][gr-site] rucksack. Unlike an app or new piece of technology, this type of product needs to be thoroughly used before a true opinion can be expressed.

However, I don't think you can call this a true review of the GR1, because I have yet to take this bag to the limits of its advertised durability and strength. That being said, it has suffered through my lifestyle; one that includes muddy soccer boots; trudging, laptop in tow, through rain and snow; being tossed into trunks, car floors and asphalt; and more.

_Note: If you want to hear the GORUCK story and how they got started, go read [their "origins letter"](gr-origins), written by GORUCK's founder, Jason McCarthy._

### <a name="zippers"></a> Zippers and pulls
The zippers are the user-experience of a bag, and Goruck uses [YKK brand zippers](http://www.ykk-usa.com). The zippers have not failed me once, and provide a very satisfying sound when zipping / unzipping.

The weakest part of the GR1 is the zipper pulls. These are small, shrink-plastic tubes that go around the string that attaches to each zipper. After aobut six months, I began to notice that my pulls were beginning to expand at each end, tearing a little as well. The string was still in tact, but I knew I would eventually want to replace the tubes. Originally, I tried sending an email to Jon Gaffney at _Gear Patrol_ who wrote about his [One Year with the GORUCK GR1](http://gearpatrol.com/2012/05/14/kit-one-year-with-the-goruck-gr1/).

I sent an email to the SCARS section of their website and got an email back that they would mail me extra pull ties free-of-charge.

### <a name="straps"></a> Straps
It doesn't matter how well-crafted a bag is, if the straps aren't able to position the weight of your load correctly, you'll be unnecesarilly physically strained.



### <a name="laptop"></a> Laptop compartment
The laptop compartment of the GR1 is large enough to fit the 17-inch Macbook Pro; however, it also keeps my 13-inch Macbook Air snuggly secured as well.



### <a name="fit"></a> Fit
One of the questions I get the most frequently are about how the GR1 fits. For reference, I'm about 5-foot-9 and find the GR1 is a near-perfect size. Officially, GORUCK recommends the GR1 for anyone 6-foot and over, however I would lower the recommended height down to around 5-8 and 5-9. If you are any shorter, the [GORUCK GR0][gr0] (a smaller version of the GR1) will suit you nicely.

If you are on the fence between a GR0 and GR1, and are around 5-8 tall, I would spend the extra $20 and go with the GR1. On countless occasions, I have found the extra space useful, whether for jackets, water bottles, or shoes.

### <a name="molle"></a> MOLLE webbing
MOLLE (Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) webbing is found on the front, both sides, and across the inside top of the GR1. In theory, you are able to attach extra pockets, clips, or gear to these straps; however, I haven't found much use for mine &mdash; outside clipping on a caribiner with my keys.

### <a name="pockets"></a> Pockets
If you are the type of person who needs lots of tiny pockets to organize your gear, the GR1 will dissuade you at first. One of the things that first drew me to the GORUCK brand is the minimalistic style they apply to their gear. Other than the laptop compartment, the GR1 has a single pocket on its exterior. Although deep, this front pocket will not hold anything too large, and I use it primarilly as a place to store my Field Notebooks and wallet.

Inside the bag, a stock GR1 gives you three different areas to store your gear. The first is
