title: New Year's Habit
---

As I contemplate 2012, less than 12 hours away at this time, I'm thinking about the New Year resolutions. While I was thinking, I read a [post by Leo Babauta on Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/fitguide/) about aiming to create new habits for the new year, rather than setting "resolutions". While the article focused on health, there were universal comments about helping to create healthy habits and have them stick. I particularly like this part:

> Instead of creating a list of resolutions this year, create a new habit.
> Habits last, and they lead to long-term fitness (and more). They require more patience, but they are worth the wait.

Changing, or creating, long-term habits are hard. Often times we set unrealistic expectations of what we want to be able to achieve and become disheartened when we can't reach those goals. This doesn't mean that we can't overcome huge obstacles and accomplish great things, but rather we need to be realistic about the journey to get there. A good source of inspiration comes from Matthew 19:26 (NIV):

> Jesus looked at them and said, <span class="jesus">"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</span>

So true, just be careful not to change "with God all things are possible" to "with God all things are easy". Change is never easy, but the results and experience along the way are well worth the effort. Be positive, adapt and learn to embrace the journey.

Here's to a safe New Year's eve and a great start to 2012.
