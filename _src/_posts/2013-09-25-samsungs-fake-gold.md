The Verge:

> Two weeks after Apple's September 10th reveal of a champagne-colored iPhone, Samsung is launching its own golden phone in the shape of a new Gold Edition Galaxy S4.

You could argue the old adage that "good artist copy, great artist steal." But _extraordinary_ artists steal great features, refine them, and then implement a better version. Samsung thinks copying features is enough, continuously duplicating other competitors without adding any real value. For them, it's a race to add bullet points to a list of features.
