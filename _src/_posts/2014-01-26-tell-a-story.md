I'm seeing a lot [of talk]() coming from some.

I double-majoring in both computer science and rhetorical writing.

I would argue that writing good shit with enough consistency *is* enough. When AAA looks at the so-called "big guy bloggers," he's ignoring the fact that they are the exception, not the rule.

John Gruber's Daring Fireball was one of the default blogs in the original version of NetNewsWire.

Shawn Blanc wrote tons of reviews.
