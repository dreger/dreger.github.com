Honesty is a value that I hold incredibly dear. As a writer, if I'm not honest with my readers, I can lose their trust and may never get it back. To that end, I'd like to write about a change I'll be making to the way I approach the topics I publish here. 

Simply put, this is no longer a "technology" blog, if it ever even was one. I may have started out trying to write about the world of new tech and gear, but as I wrote more and more, I realized that my real interests and passions stem from the topics of writing, design, and the goodness of God in my life. Does technology occasionally cross into these areas of conversation? Absolutely. I love to dissect the rhetorical design and effectiveness of interfaces and hardware, but my main focus will become one more centered around what I love: writing and design. 

<aside>This doesn't mean I won't cover any technology stories, but I will be adjusting the threshold and criteria for what I constitute as worth sharing with all of you.</aside>

With that said, and does it feel good to say, I would like to welcome you to the rebirth of this humble little webcolumn. With a focus on God, design, writing and rhetoric, I am excited to see what flows from this keyboard to your screen.

Thanks for reading,<br>
