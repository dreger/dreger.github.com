# The Log
A journal of my journey taking this website to SCE project level.

## October 7, 2013
The NYT Manual of Style has come in great handy. However, I've found a faster way to do most of my queries as of late:

Go to Google.com and enter into the search box: "site:nytimes.com X" replacing X with whatever word / words you're querying. This will return pages of Google results with term X *only from The New York Times website*. Often I can tell within a few seconds what the "correct" usage is, and I'm able to confindently go forward.

I did some research as to what manuals of style Daring Fireball, Shawn Blanc, and Marco Arment are using for their sites. Arment and Blanc appears to be using their own personal guides, as they've written nothing on the subject. Gruber, however, follows the New York Times Manual of Style [1].

As a writer new to column writing, I want to have a style guide on my desk to help keep me consistent. After seeing that Gruber follows the NYT's style guide, I decided to do the same. I was going to purchase it through Amazon, but found out that our library already had a copy, so I checked it out.

I created the Twitter account @kyledregernet and set up an recipe on ifttt.com to have every new article posted to kyledreger.net automatically sent to tweet. This will allow my personal @kyledreger account to retweet the articles that are big enough to warrant my Twitter audience, but leave it up to the reader whether they want to get notified about every link and article I post.

I've set up an email which readers can use to contact me about the column. I didn't want to use my school email, as that's something a little more personal than I wanted to share, and I wanted something @kyledreger.net. I debated between the following usernames:

- desk@kyledreger.net: allows it to be used as a more general-purpose email address for the site, but it's not as memorable for the readers. Shawn Blanc uses this for his site.
- comments@kyledreger.net: very specific use (just for comments and thoughts) and used by John Gruber at Daring Fireball.

I ended up choosing to use comments@kyledreger.net due to its memorable name for my readers.

## September 19, 2013
After much debate, I've decided to purchase kyledreger.net as the new domain for my column. This decision was influenced by two factors:

1. Two of the three websites (Daring Fireball, Shawn Blanc) which I wrote down as influences for this project use the ".net" domain; with the ".com" equivalent forwarding to the ".net"
2. I feel that in an internet of ".com"s, there is some ethos to be gained by using the more personal ".net" - it's a matter of style.

I went and switched over all the DNS and domain settings so now anyone visiting kyledreger.com will be forwarded to kyledreger.net.

Added a new type of post! Linked posts are now available to me for linking to an article that I find interesting, but not necessarily worth a full blown article. Fun stuff.

I've also finally nailed on a design that I really like. I toyed with the idea of the site feeling natural on whatever computer you're using, so I decided to go with a fresh set of system fonts that not a lot of websites use. The other upside to this is that the website loads really freaking fast.

## September 15, 2013
Whoa, people really like posts about things that they can "act on" i.e.: the post about where to get the best desktop wallpapers. I'm also learning a little bit about when the best time to post articles is. Sunday night is great, but it's probably the only night that works. Every other weeknight should be put up earlier - around 4-5 maybe.

I've installed Ghostery[1] on all my browsers so that my own personal visits to kyledreger.com don't show up in the analytics. I'm probably the most frequent visitor to my site at the moment (to check on formating, design, etc.), and I don't want that skewing my visitor count or page view metrics.
