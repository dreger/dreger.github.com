# Podcasts

I currently host two podcasts:

## The Log
A [weekly, geeky discussion](/log) about technology, science, and gaming with co-host, Chris Durr. The show is avilable [on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-log/id830009186?mt=2). 

## The Margins
A [short, single-topic, daily-ish podcast](/margins) on a variety of topics including: writing, iOS, apps, reading, running, eating, thinking, smiling, designing, speaking, and more.
