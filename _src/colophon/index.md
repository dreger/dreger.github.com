## Colophon
Writen and produced by me, Kyle Dreger.

My first post here coincided with the [start of my college career]({% post_url 2010-08-27-hello-college %}). Inspiration comes from [my faith](http://bible.us/116/psa.1.3.nlt) and a love for building beautiful things. Offline, I play soccer, code and am <s>dating</s> engaged to the most incredible woman.

### This site
I use [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format via [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com) or [iA Writer](http:iawriter.com).
<br><br>
Typefaces are set in Avenir Next (Mac) and Segoe UI (Windows) for the headings and Georgia for the body copy.
