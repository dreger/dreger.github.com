# About

My name is Kyle Dreger, and I work as a user experience designer. This site houses my thoughts on the topics of writing, technology, and design.

_I'm currently enjoying life with my new wife, so things are on a small hiatus._

### Colophon
I use [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format.

Type is set in [H&amp;Co's](http://typography.com) Ideal Sans.
