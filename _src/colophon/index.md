# About Audacious Fox

My name is Kyle Dreger, and I am a user experience designer. This website is the tech / writing / design column that I've always wanted to read. _Note: I'm currently enjoying life with my new wife, so things have temporarily slowed down._

I use [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format.

Type is set in [H&amp;Co's](http://typography.com) Ideal Sans. Read the [styleguide](/styleguide).
