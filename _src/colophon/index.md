This is a small webcolumn that features long-form articles and short commentary on design, writing, technology, and the news therein. Written daily-ish by Kyle Dreger, and the views / opinions expressed here are his own.

Please send all comments and correspondence to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kyledreger), [App.net](http://alpha.app.net/kyledreger), or by email: <dregerkq@mountunion.edu>

## Conflicts of Interest
I do not own any stock or other investments in any of the companies I write about.

Generally, any links that I post to Amazon or iTunes will carry my affiliate tag, which basically means I get a small kickback if you buy any of the items I link to. Thanks!

## The Nuts and Bolts
A combination of [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) are used to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format.

Type is set in Myriad Pro (OS X) and Segoe UI (Windows).
