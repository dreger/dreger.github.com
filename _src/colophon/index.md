Welcome to my webcolumn. I write and curate the news, with a focus on the topics of writing, technology, and design. This site was hand-coded in Ohio and was made on a Mac. Written daily-ish by me, Kyle Dreger.

Please send all comments and correspondence to [@kyledreger](http://twitter.com/kyledreger) or email:

### Conflicts of Interest
I do not own any stock or other investments in any of the companies I write about.

Generally, any links that I post to Amazon or iTunes will carry my affiliate tag, which basically means I get a small kickback if you buy any of the items I link to. Thanks!

### The Nuts and Bolts
A combination of [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) are used to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format.

Type is set in [H&Co's](http://typography.com) Gotham.
