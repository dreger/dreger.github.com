## Colophon
Writen by me, Kyle Dreger. I'm a computer science and English writing student currently attending a small university in Ohio. This website serves as my column about technology, design, and great gear.

### Quick bio
I started writing here when [I began attending]({% post_url 2010-08-27-hello-college %}) the University of Mount Union. Inspiration comes from [my faith](http://bible.us/116/psa.1.3.nlt) and a love for building beautiful software. Offline, I play soccer, code and am <s>dating</s> engaged to the most incredible woman.

### This site
I use [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format via [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com) or [iA Writer](http:iawriter.com).
<br><br>
Typefaces are set in Avenir Next (Mac) and Segoe UI (Windows) for the headings and Georgia for the body copy.
