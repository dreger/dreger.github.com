This is a small webcolumn that focuses on how design can be applied to writing, technology, and craft.  Made in Ohio, made on a Mac. Written daily-ish by Kyle Dreger.

## Conflicts of Interest
I do not own any stock or other investments in any of the companies I write about.

Generally, any links that I post to Amazon or iTunes will carry my affiliate tag, which basically means I get a small kickback if you buy any of the items I link to. Thanks!

## The Nuts and Bolts
A combination of [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) are used to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format.

Type is set in Avenir Next (OS X) and Segoe UI (Windows).
