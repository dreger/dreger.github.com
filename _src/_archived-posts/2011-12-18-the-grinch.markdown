title: The Grinch

[How the Grinch Stole Christmas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170016/) is one of my favorite movies to watch when December roles around. In fact, it was one of the first movies I remember going to see in theaters as a family. I recall we all went to a matin√©e showing before heading to a family Christmas party. The Grinch also got my dad to laugh out loud, multiple times, something that few movies can claim to have done.

From the one-liners, which I still quote with my brother to this day, to the subtle adult references, I love this movie. I look forward to every year when we he runs though the ridiculous town of Whoville.

And Max. Max is awesome. Fa-Who Foray, to all.
