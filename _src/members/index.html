<h1>Membership Information</h1>


<p>A membership to kyledreger.com is the best way to help support this site and my writing. It is important to note that membership is not required to view any of the content on this site (that stuff will <strong>always</strong> be free), but I have created some perks for those who do take the plunge:</p>

<p class="center"><strong>Price: $2.25 <span class="small-caps">a month</span></strong></p>

<a class="button" href="https://plasso.co/s/2ySr0fxhGd">Become a member of kyledreger.com</a>

<p class="center"><a href="https://plasso.co/s/2ySr0fxhGd/manage/">Existing member login</a> &mdash; <a href="/colophon">Contact</a></p>

<h3>Memberhip perks</h3>

<p><strong>Newsletter</strong> &mdash; A handwritten, weekly newsletter that contains some of the best links and commentary that I didn't post to kyledreger.com. My goal for this newsletter is to give my members a relaxed, personal email, filled with links that I think complement a good cup of coffee and a weekend afternoon. </p>


<!-- <p><strong>Giveaways</strong> &mdash; Free stuff. Members get automatic entry into any prize giveaways (apps promo codes, eBooks, technology gear) that I do throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Podcast: <em>Noted</em></strong> &mdash;  (<em>Coming 8/1/2014, once I move into my apartment</em>) &mdash; A members-only podcast, focused on craft, coffee, and creating. About 5-10 minutes per episode.</p> -->


<h3>Order processing</h3>

<p>My membership system is backed by <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, a proven and reliable payment processing service (like PayPal, but way less sketchy). On top of Stripe, I use <a href="http://plasso.co">Plasso</a> to provide a secure and easy way for you to manage subscription and credit card information.</p>
