<h1>Membership Information</h1>

<p>Price: $2.25 <span class="small-caps">a month</span></p>

<p>A membership to kyledreger.com is the best way to help support this site and my writing. Membership is not required to view the front page or archives (that stuff will <strong>always</strong> be free), but I have created some perks for those who do take the plunge:</p>

<h3>Memberhip perks</h3>

<p><strong>Newsletter</strong> &mdash; A handwritten, weekly newsletter that contains some of the best links and commentary that I didn't post to kyledreger.com. My goal for this newsletter is to give my members a relaxed, personal email, filled with links that I think complement a good cup of coffee and a weekend afternoon. </p>


<p><strong>Giveaways</strong> &mdash; Free stuff. Members get automatic entry into any prize giveaways (apps promo codes, eBooks, technology gear) that I do throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Podcast: <em>Noted</em></strong> &mdash;  (<em>Coming 8/1/2014, once I move into my apartment</em>) &mdash; A members-only podcast, focused on craft, coffee, and creating. About 5-10 minutes per episode.</p>

<h3>Order processing</h3>

<p>My membership system is backed by <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, a proven and reliable payment processing service (like PayPal, but waaaay less sketchy). On top of Stripe, I use <a href="http://plasso.co">Plasso</a> to provide a secure and easy way for you to manage subscription and credit card information.</p>
