<h1>Support this Site</h1>

<p>Membership price: $2.25 <span class="small-caps">a month</span></p>


<p>A membership to kyledreger.com is the best way to help support this site and my writing. A membership includes the following member-only perks:</p>

<p><strong>Newsletter</strong> &mdash; A personal newsletter that goes out at the end of every week. This email will contain some of the best links (and commentary) I didn't post to kyledreger.com.</p>


<p><strong>Giveaways</strong> &mdash; Free stuff! Members get automatic entry into any prize giveaways (apps promo codes, eBooks, technology gear) that I do throughout the year.</p>

<h3>When I move into my apartment (~ July 1, 2014)</h3>
<p><strong>Podcast: <em>Noted</em></strong> &mdash; A members-only podcast, focused on craft, coffee, and creating. About 5-10 minutes per episode.</p>
