I am a UX Developer, writer, public speaker, and family guy.

I tweet [@dreger](http://twitter.com/dreger).

## UX Developer

I love writing in Ruby and using Ruby on Rails to develop web applications. I also spend a great deal of time being an advocate for the user through user experience. I currently work at [Synergy Data Systems](http://synergydatasystems.com).

## Writer

I have a [few essays here](/essays.html), but there's much more on [Audacious Fox](http://audaciousfox.com). I focus on writing and the web. 

## Public speaker
I've been public speaking since I was eight years-old. At university, I was a consultant for our Written and Oral Communication center, where students could get tutored in writing and speaking. 

I've given [several presentations](http://www.mountunion.edu/student-presents-iphone-application-at-scholar-day) [about the web and mobile technology](http://www.the-review.com/local%20news/2014/02/15/chamber-seminar-focuses-on-mobile-technology).

And I also gave the commencement speech at graduation.
