Hello&mdash;I'm Kyle Dreger, [@dreger on Twitter](http://twitter.com/dreger). I do full-stack development and ux at [Synergy Data Systems](http://synergydatasystems.com). I used to do a [lot of writing here](/archives), but I've since moved to writing at [Audacious Fox](http://audaciousfox.com).

I've been public speaking since I was eight years-old. I've given [several presentations](http://www.mountunion.edu/student-presents-iphone-application-at-scholar-day) [about the web](https://speakerdeck.com/dreger/mobile-applications-and-the-mobile-web) [and mobile technology](http://www.the-review.com/local%20news/2014/02/15/chamber-seminar-focuses-on-mobile-technology). I also gave the [commencement speech at graduation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I78OflS6hWc).

This is my wife, Emily.
