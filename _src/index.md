Hello! My name is Kyle Dreger. On a normal day, I write and curate the news, with a focus on the topics of writing, technology, and design. Currently, I'm in the process of marrying a smart, beautiful girl, so things are on a small hiatus.

### The Nuts and Bolts
A combination of [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) are used to publish this site. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (love them, highly recommend), and posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format.

Type is set in [H&amp;Co's](http://typography.com) Ideal Sans.
