title: Nature's distraction
---

My girlfriend and I were recently sitting in the library doing homework when it began to rain outside. The sound of raindrops hitting the roof sounded like a roar of a jet engine right outside the nearby window. A couple of minutes later she asked me if I wanted to see a poem she had written for one of her literature classes. I liked it so much that I asked her for a copy. She graciously agreed and I would like to share it with you.

>Startling pellets of water shoot at the rooftop  
>First, slow then picking up faster, then louder   
>Until it makes you stop and look out the window.  
>The steady build-up of noise,  
>like the noise of an on-coming train.   
>In the background, music pouring out of headphones,   
>secondary to the rain.  
>My fingers pressing down the keys as I write.  
>Finally these secondary noises become primary   
>To the rooftop echo as nature begins to calm.  
>It is then, I focus on my work,  
>Until the rain starts again.
