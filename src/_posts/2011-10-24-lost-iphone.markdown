title: I lost my iPhone
---

Fun little thing that happened to me today:

Was walking in the library when I went to grab my iPhone, but it wasn't in my pocket. I checked my bag and laptop case, but it wasn't there either. I started to freak out a bit. I didn't have a passcode set and thinking of how many websites it was authenticated with made me sweat.

I quickly went to a computer, logged on to iCloud.com and went to Find My iPhone. I saw a little GPS pin drop on the east side of the library and start moving towards the circulation desk. After marveling at this realtime event, I remotely set the passcode and had it show the message "Please call:" with my girlfriend's cell phone number. Five minutes later the circulation desk calls her. They have my phone and we walk over to pick it up.

Apple rocks. 

_Special thanks to my girlfriend and her calming demeanor towards what, I'm sure, was a very hysterical 19 year old._
