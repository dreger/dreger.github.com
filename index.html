  <p>Welcome to my online home, which is, by contrast, a million times more clean and organized than my actual home. This is a space for me to share things I've written.</p>
  
  <p>I do a lot of writing at <a href="http://audaciousfox.net">Audacious Fox</a>. Recent topics of interesting include: storytelling through video games, the mechanics of writing, typography, web publishing, and my myriad of Apple devices.</p>
  
  
  <p>You are looking at the latest iteration of many, many designs. This version is engineered to be super lightweight, devoid of analytics and trackers, and typeset for a comfortable reading experience.</p>
  
  <p>My day job, Patriot Software's Lead UX Designer, is fun. Since words are the foundation of web design, I get to do a decent bit of writing at work, which makes me happy. Speaking of my employer, opinions on this site are my own.</p>

  <p>I don't know why you'd follow me on Twitter, but <a href="https://twitter.com/dreger">here you go</a>. Get notified of new articles via <a href="/feeds/main.xml">RSS</a>. I enjoy email, so lets talk at <a href="mailto:comments@dreger.me?subject=Hello!">comments@dreger.me</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

  <p>Over the years, I've hidden most of my old posts from the homepage. These articles are still available if you know the address, or you can go to <a href="/index2.html">this index of everything</a>.</p>
