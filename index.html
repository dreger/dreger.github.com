<h2 class="title">The man</h2>
<p>Currently a student studying computer science &amp; english writing. Loves to play soccer and design. More reserved than loud unless you're playing him in FIFA.</p>
<p>Has the most beautiful girlfriend in the world. </p>

<h2 class="title">The myth</h2>
<p>He may or may not have: outrun a cheetah, boxed a polar bear for eight rounds and won, helped raise many small farm animals as a surrogate mother, handled most of the diplomatic policy between the U.S.A. and Canada, actually built this website.</p>

<div class="col">
<h2 class="title">The legend</h2>
<p>Hopefully to be one of a man who helped others when he could, loved his family and held nothing back, used his skills from God to help make the world, and his own little piece of it, better than when he got here.</p>
