### Rise

Across various networks, you'll see my superhero symbol. It represents my philosophy of "rise" - to always be moving up and forward in everything you do. 

### Setup

[GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) generate this site - keeping it lightweight, and static. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (seriously, love them). You may occasionally see custom typefaces here, and those are served by the lovely [Typekit](http://typekit.com). 

Writing is done via [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) formatting. The writing takes place on either a 13' Macbook Pro, or an iPhone 4.

### Comments
