### Good day

This is the humble tech- and design centric weblog of Kyle Dreger. You can find his [tweets](http://twitter.com/dreger), [code](http://github.com/dreger) and [links](http://pinboard.in/u:dreger) elsewhere on the web. He's also designed several [Tumblr themes](http://tumblr.com/themes/by/dregers). 

This blog was born in the fall of 2010, when Kyle began attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu). He loves clean, honest design, Apple things, writing out ideas and playing soccer. He also has the most beautiful girlfriend in the world. 

If you had to describe Kyle in one sentence, it might look like this: a passionate individual who lives to help people. Hopefully you found something here to enjoy, thank you for reading. 

### Rise

Across various networks, you'll see my superhero symbol. It represents my philosophy of "rise" - to always be moving up and forward in everything you do. 

### Setup

[GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) generate this site - keeping it lightweight, and static. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (seriously, love them). You may occasionally see custom typefaces here, and those are served by the lovely [Typekit](http://typekit.com). 

Writing is done via [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) formatting. The writing takes place on either a 13' Macbook Pro, or an iPhone 4.

### Comments
