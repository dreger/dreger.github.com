Hello! And welcome to the humble website of Kyle Dreger. You can find his [tweets](http://twitter.com/dreger), [code](http://github.com/dreger) and [links](http://pinboard.in/u:dreger) elsewhere on the web. He's not very good at writing in the third person, so I'm going to stop before harm befalls any innocent pronouns. 

I started this site in the fall of 2010 when I began attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu). I do write quite a bit of about faith, design, Apple things, and coffee. I'm a Christian ([have a verse!](http://bible.us/116/psa.1.3.nlt)) and I also have the most beautiful girlfriend in the world - no contest. 

If you'd like to comment on something I've written, or just want to say hello, shoot an email to <hi@kyledreger.com> or @ [dreger](http://twitter.com/dreger) on Twitter. 

### Setup

[GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) generate this site - keeping it lightweight, and static. The domain lives on [Hover](http://hover.com) (seriously, love them). You may occasionally see custom typefaces here, and those are served by the lovely [Typekit](http://typekit.com). 

Writing is done via [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) formatting. The writing takes place on either a 13' Macbook Pro, or an iPhone 4.
