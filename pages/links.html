<p>The Audacious Fox Briefings are short posts that revolve around an article, video, or image that I think you should check out. Briefings typically include a quote from the original content, and I always include a link to any relevant sources.</p>

{% for link in site.data.links  %}
<article class="article">
  <header class="article-header">  
    <h1 class="headline"><a href="{{ link.url }}">{{ link.new_title }}</a></h1>
    <p class="headline-date">{{ link.date | date: "%b %e" }}</p>
  </header>
  <span class="faded">{{ link.title }}</span>
  <br>
  <span class="link-source">{{ link.source }}</span>
</article>
{% endfor %}
