Welcome. My name is K.Q. Dreger, and I write and produce this website. I currently work as a user experience designer at the Patriot Software Companies. 

Topics for this column include technology, design, video games, and science. When I'm not available, Dr. Christopher B. Durr will take over as guest editor.

## Miscellany  

Editorial style follows that of the _New York Times Manual of Style_, with several modifications from my own in-house style guide. 

Waffles are the best breakfast food ever. Period.
