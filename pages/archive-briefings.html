<p>The Audacious Fox Briefings are short posts that revolve around an article, video, or image that I think you should check out. Briefings typically include a quote from the original content, and I always include a link to any relevant sources.</p>

<p>On the front page, Briefings are set in all caps to distinguish them from my original pieces.</p>

<p>An archive for just my longer articles can <a href="/archive">be found here</a>.</p>
<ul class="archive">

  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> <small>{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}</small></li>
{% endfor %}
