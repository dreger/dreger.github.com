<!--### <a name="notes"></a> Notes from Coach
- Week 2 &mdash; Our first match was hard fought, and I was happy with the result! This week we've been working on keeping our formation throughout matches, and we've been spending a lot of time on moving the ball from one end of the pitch to the other. We've also started introducing more cardio into the training sessions, and I'm excited to see how it pays off during the coming match.
- Week 1 &mdash; We've had a good first week of practice and really focused on the fundamentals. I liked how much we were communicating during the passing drills, and I like the intensity that was shown during our Germany vs Brazil drill. Keep up the hard work!
- Preseason &mdash; Welcome players and parents! I'm excited to get this season underway, and I look forward to meeting you all at our first training session. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email or text message. See you at training on August 11!-->

### <a name="training"></a> Training Schedule
Beginning August 11, training will be every Tuesday and Thursday from 6pm-7:15. Sessions will be held at Washington Elementary School, which can be found at [5786 Beechwood Avenue, Alliance, OH](https://goo.gl/maps/mbHJS).

Keepers: After training, I'll be sticking around for an extra 20 minutes to try some goalie training. This is completely optional (it doesn't affect your playing time as keeper), but I wanted to start working on a few keeper-specific drills.

Players should bring a water bottle and proper playing equipment. Shinguards are required for each training session.
