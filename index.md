Hi, I'm K.Q. Dreger. I work at [Patriot Software](https://patriotsoftware.com/) where I empower our product and design teams as the director of product. 

I have a deep love of writing. Whether it's code for computers or words for people, I think good writing is good design—and clarity in writing leads to clarity of thought. 

Say hello via [email](/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/dreger). (Oh, and "Kyle" is fine—I just sign my name KQ.)
