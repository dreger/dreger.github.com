Hi, I'm K.Q. Dreger. I work at [Patriot Software](https://patriotsoftware.com/) where I empower our product and design teams as the director of product. 

I have a deep love of writing, whether it's code for computers or prose for people. I think good writing is good designâ€”and clarity in writing leads to clarity of thought.
