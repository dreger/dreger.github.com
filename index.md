# $18/year to keep this little page on the internet—just for you.

Hello, I'm K.Q. Dreger. I work at [Patriot Software](https://patriotsoftware.com/) where I empower our product and design teams as the director of product. We're building some of the fastest, simplest, and most affordable online software for small businesses—so if that sounds like fun, [come join us](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/about/careers/).

I have a deep love of writing. Whether it's code for computers or words for people, I think good writing is good design—and clarity in writing leads to clarity of thought. 

I'm happy to talk about design, product, writing, or tech. Just [email](https://audaciousfox.net/masthead) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/dreger) me. Oh, and "Kyle" is fine—I just sign my name KQ.
