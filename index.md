Welcome to the humble website of Kyle Dreger. You can find his [tweets](http://twitter.com/dreger), [code](http://github.com/dreger) and [links](http://pinboard.in/u:dreger) elsewhere on the web. He's not very good at writing in the third person, so I'm going to stop before I harm any innocent pronouns. 

I started this site in the fall of 2010 when I began attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu). I do quite a bit of [writing](/weblog) about Jesus, design, Apple things, and coffee. I also has the most beautiful girlfriend in the world - no contest. 

If you'd like to comment on something I've written, or just want to say hello, shoot an email to <hi@kyledreger.com> or [@dreger](http://twitter.com/dreger) on Twitter.
