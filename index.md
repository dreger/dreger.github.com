# @dreger's website

I work at [Patriot Software](https://patriotsoftware.com/)
where I empower our product and design teams. We're building some of the fastest, 
simplest, and most affordable online software for small 
businesses—so if that sounds like fun, [come join us](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/about/careers/).

By night, I write about design and tech at [Audacious Fox](https://audaciousfox.net). By nighter night, I make a small iOS app called [Edit](https://audaciousfox.net/projects/edit). I live in Northeast Ohio with my wife, son, and small dog.

Happy to talk about design, books, or tech. [Email](https://audaciousfox.net/masthead) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dreger). Oh, and "Kyle" is fine—I just sign my name KQ.
