# Hello ✌️

Welcome to my website. I'm K.Q. Dreger. By day I work at [Patriot](https://patriotsoftware.com/), where I get to empower our engineering, product, design, and research teams as the vp of product. By night I write about products, people, and punctuation. And by nighter night I bake. Pizza, mostly.
