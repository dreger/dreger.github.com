# Hi, Hey, Hello 

<!-- <img class="ppp" src="/images/ppp.jpeg"> -->

Welcome to my website. I'm K.Q. Dreger. ✌️


By day I work at [Patriot](https://patriotsoftware.com/), where I get to lead our engineering, product, design, and research teams as the VP of Product. 


By night I write about products, people, and punctuation. By nighter night I bake. Pizza, mostly.
