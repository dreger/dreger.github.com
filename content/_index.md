# Hi, welcome to my website. ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm [K.Q. Dreger](/about/). By day I work at [Patriot](https://patriotsoftware.com/), where I get to empower our product and design teams as the director of product. By night I [write](/notes.html) about products, people, and punctuation. And by nighter night I bake. Bread, mostly.
