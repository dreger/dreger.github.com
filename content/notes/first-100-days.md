A lot of companies talk about the first 90 days. It'll take you 90 days to acclimate to the new job. 90 day performance reviews. Et cetera. 

But that all starts after someone's already started the job. What about before they even officially begin? What about the 10 days beforehand? 

We try to look at things a bit more holistically. The 10 days before you arrive should be exciting! They should be reassuring. You should get questions answered and feel confident in the first few days in the new role.
