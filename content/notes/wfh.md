summary: The routine I've settled into.

Up at 6:30. Drink a full glass of water, take a shower, get dressed. Put on some tennis shoes. I tried slippers for a while, but a standing desk calls for extra arch support.

Downstairs, start the coffee. 50 grams for about 6 cups. It's a weaker brew, but that means I can have a few cups without getting twitchy. Water, meet stovetop pot. Add oats. Oats and yogurt with a little brown sugar is quite simply the best a breakfast can ever hope to be.

Family time, morning talks, good vibes. It's about 8:00. Another 10-15 minutes, then I’ll grab a large cup of coffee and head upstairs to the office.

Crack the windows, let lots of sunshine stream in. 

8:15-45 is my chance to parse the day. I start with a beat of silence and a prayer, then I take a large sip of coffee and flick open a variety of windows. 

First up, Slack and email.

90% of my Slack channels are muted. My notifications are off by default, which helps me treat Slack a bit more like email and a touch less like a 90s pager. I scan all unread channels and DMs, then throw anything warranting a followup into Starred. 

Email is next. Through years of tweaking and filter creation, email is like my Millenium Falcon—filled with really old stuff but tuned exactly how I like it. Everything in my inbox is signal. 

Within several minutes, Slack and email are completely dispatched. Now to the calendar. What am I attending today? Tomorrow? What information do I need to have at the ready? What did the bug count look like this week? Which teams have key members on PTO? Did the last 24 hours of pulse metrics look like I expected? 

Close the windows, because the sun is doing its thing and warming up the Earth. 

Visually, my calendar is stuffed. But a third of those chunky boxes are meetings with myself. Margin time, at least 1-2 hours, every single day. It’s here that I work on my Most Important Things. 

What are the Most Important Things? I have a simple system: take the top 2-4 most important things I could do this week and put them on a flashcard. The rest of the day will be about relentlessly attempting to complete everything on this list. I'll usually get through about half, while adding 8-10 new items along the way. Tomorrow I’ll prune it back down to the top 2-4. Rinse, repeat. 


(What about a to-do app? I use one, but I use it differently than most. The only things that go in here are commitments I’ve made to other people. My to-do app is my your-word-means-something app. Anytime I make a promise, a keystroke later that item is in a nice list of things that need a follow-up.)

Pop downstairs, grab some snuggles from the kiddo, refill the coffee, and hike back upstairs.

The rest of the day will be oscillating between meetings and my Most Important Things. For meetings, I have a yellow legal pad and a .5mm rollerball. I used to roll with a .38mm, but the .5 feels way more messy and therefore better. Once the day is wrapped, I'll go back through every page of notes and move things into my to-do app or onto the calendar. I've thought about an iPad for some of this writing, but I like paper. Again, the mess of it all is what makes it great.

Before shutting everything down, I journal for 5-10 minutes. This is some of the most important writing I do every day. I focus on decisions I made and why I made them.

Downstairs, dinner, books, bed, and hope to be just a little bit better tomorrow.
