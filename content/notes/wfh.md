Up by 6:30. Check the RSS feeds even though they haven't changed since 20:00 last night. Drink a full glass of water, shower, and get dressed. Put on some tennis shoes. I tried slippers for a while, but with a standing desk I appreciate the extra arch support of running shoes. 

Downstairs, start some coffee. 50 grams of beans for about 6 cups of coffee. Yes, I know it's a weaker brew ratio, but it lets me have a few cups without getting twitchy. Throw water in a pot on the stove to boil and measure out 2 cups of oats. Oats and yogurt with a little brown sugar is quite simply the best breakfast you can have. 

By now the rest of the house is up. Everyone else gets dressed. I do morning with the kiddo, since I won't see him much for the rest of the working day. Downstairs, breakfast, first cup of coffee. It's about 8:00. Another 10-15 minutes and I'll be upstairs in my office. 

8:15-30 are a clarifying few moments to parse the day. Slack and email are quickly dispatched before turning to the calendar. What am I attending? What information do I need to have at the ready? 

Next I scrub my to-do list. The only thing that goes in here are items I've promised to get done for other people. My task list is my your-word-means-something list. For _my_ ideas or to-dos, I have a simpler process: take the top 3-5 things I need to do today and put them on a flashcard. The rest of the day will be about relentlessly attempting to complete whatever's on that list. I'll usually get through about half.
