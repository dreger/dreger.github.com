Productivity is largely your ability to get things done and remember every commitment. If you create a system that helps you do these two things, you will likely be more productive than most of the people you know. 

## 1: Stop using your brain for tasks

Your brain is helpful while doing things, but it's not great at storing and recalling information—thankfully, computers are. Accept this and start using an app to track your tasks. 

There are only two qualifications for a task manager: lists and the ability to capture tasks anywhere you are. Lists come standard on every app I've seen, so you're probably safe there. But universal capture is less prevalent. Essentially, whatever app you choose should make it easy to add tasks on-the-go or at your desk. Beyond those two requirements, the specific app doesn't really matter. (I use Things by Cultured Code.) Just pick the one you like best and commit to using it. 

Using your app is pretty straightforward. For most people, I think you only need to create four lists: 

- Inbox
- Next
- Waiting 
- Someday

**Inbox**: digital dumping grounds. Put no thought or effort into what you’re capturing here, just get it out of your head and into the app. 

**Next**: all things that, if able, you could work on right now.

**Waiting**: sometimes you're blocked on a task by someone else. Keep track of that here, so you know who to follow up with.

**Someday**: it's not always the right time to work on something. Throw those tasks here.

Some other loose notes:

Don't overuse due dates. Only things that MUST be completed by a certain date should have a date. Otherwise you'll have to think about whether a task's date is fixed or flexible. Remove the ambiguity—either the date is the most important thing, or it doesn't matter.


## 2. Carry a notebook

I just told you to use an app, but apps require phones, tablets, or computers and I dislike those in meetings or on the go. A small notebook and pen are perfect as a short-term place to capture anything in your head. Write things down throughout the day, and then once a day move all tasks into the app and cross out everything in the notebook. This gives you the benefit of the app when it comes to organization and the speed/social acceptance of paper/pen when you need it.


## 3. Really. Stop using your brain for tasks. 

Make a commitment? Put it in the Inbox. Remember you need to buy eggs? Inbox. Find an article you want to read later? Inbox. Get the picture? 

Review and empty the Inbox list a few times a day. Over the next few weeks, you’ll get to experience the profound relief that comes with knowing your mental state of the moment has zero impact on your ability to (a) get things done and (b) remember commitments later. 


In addition to just committing to the system, there are a few other tips I have to help really get things done consistently: 

**Morning and evening routines**: Every night, reserve 5-10 minutes to review your next day's calendar events and scrub through your Next list. Highlight (and mark) the 3-5 things you want to work on the next day. Every morning, jump straight into your top task. Ideally you should schedule at least 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time (especially before even checking email and Slack) to work on your top task. I have to block out the time on my calendar. This is usually 8:30-9:15 for me. I'm trying to extend that to a full hour.

**Only check email (and Slack, etc.) twice a day**: You won't miss anything important, I promise. I check them once at 9:00 and again at 16:50. When you do decide to check the various inboxes of your life, always snooze, archive, or reply to every message. Leave your inboxes empty. 

**Get off your phone**: If it's for work, leave it on work devices. Checking our phones is my generation's smoke break. Maybe you can't delete email from your phone (although I'd encourage you to try). But turn off notifications for email, and set messaging to only send you notifications for channels you absolutely need to receive messages for. In general, remove any apps on your phone that aren't for communicating between real people. This means most social networking apps, games, news. Set aside some time each night to binge those things. I promise you won't miss them. They're sucking your time away to the tunes of hours and tens of hours a week. If you choose to keep them, don't then take to those same tools to complain about how hard it is to find time for your side hustle.


### Wrap up and an aside on productivity blogs (careful not to insult SB)

For every productivity app that exists, there are 100 blogs out there that get into obscene detail about how to use the app to its fullest potential. For every productivity app blogger, there are 1,000 opinions and Recommended™ workflows. 

Ignore all of this. 

Sure, you could eek out an additional 5% of productivity by becoming one with your app of choice, but let’s be honest: if you’re already tracking your productivity in terms of percentages then there’s little I can do to persuade you into doing otherwise.
