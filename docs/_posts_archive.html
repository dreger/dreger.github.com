      <h2>Not Yet</h2>
      <p>Ben Brooks and Michael Rockwell both brought up the topic of going iOS only, and the maintenance that goes into tuning and running macOS (née OS X). <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/06/ios-only/">Brooks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I lost 30 minutes to just managing my Mac that morning.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet my iPad was just there, did it’s job and stayed the hell out of my way, and never once demanded I do housekeeping on it. The apps update in the background. The devices backs up each night automatically. It’s just always ready to go. That’s simply not the case with my Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://initialcharge.net/2016/06/brooks-ios-primary/">Rockwell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Managing a Mac requires <em>a lot</em> of overhead and I’m doing almost everything in my power to minimize the chore associated with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within Apple circles, going iOS only is a fairly common topic. There are enough apps, workarounds, and community involvement that if the Mac disappeared tomorrow, most people could get their jobs done with iOS.</p>
<p>However, iOS isn’t there yet for a lot of people. Namely, developers.</p>
<p>Writing code, managing servers, and deploying builds — i.e. building the things that make the iOS-only world possible — is just not something that we can get done on iOS yet. Arguably, iOS may never support some of these things. Root access, installing command-line tools, piping terminal commands into a local output file all fly in the face of security and ease-of-use, both of which are iOS cornerstones.</p>
<p>And yes, I could hack together a solution for some of these things by setting up a remote server, SSH, and VNC, but the switching cost in terms or productivity is just too high. Additionally, why should I need to buy or rent <em>another</em> machine just to do all these things that macOS can do out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>iOS can be powerful and simple because macOS is powerful and complex.</p>
<p>Yes, macOS takes more maintenance than iOS (to which I say “duh”), but those are tradeoffs that give me access to the full machine in front of me.</p>
<p>iOS does an excellent job at abstracting the messy details and maintenance of running an operating system, leaving us with an experience that’s simple and safe. But we still need folks who build the things that everyone else is using, and to build a lot of those things, iOS doesn’t make the cut yet.</p>

      <h2>Snapchat and Sharing First Drafts</h2>
      <p>Recently, Chris Bowler asked the following question in his <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/newsletter">The Weekly Review</a> email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what does Snapchat offer people other than another distraction from getting work done? That’s a serious question. Do you have an answer? <em>Let me know</em>, I’d love to better understand how and why people use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By &ldquo;people,&rdquo; Mr. Bowler is referring to other creatives, those who might work in design, art, or writing fields.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon thinking about my answer to that question, and I arrived at this:</p>
<p>Sharing honest, rough draft work on most platforms means looking amateur next to the competition.</p>
<p>Snapchat runs the other way. Snapchat-the-platform encourages a &ldquo;shitty first draft&rdquo; mentality that creatives struggle to find elsewhere, even on services dedicated to in-progress work. [1] Unlike posts on Facebook, Twitter, Dribbble, and Instagram, Snapchat encourages rough-edged peeks into who we are and what we&rsquo;re doing. Snaps are born into a context that embraces messy. [2]</p>
<p>Additionally, Snapchat removes any affordance to meaningfully polish your work before sharing. You do have drawing tools and a limited selection of filters, but drawing with your finger is obtuse and the filters are the most basic implementation of such a feature. Most everything about Snapchat facilities sharing the in-progress, and I think creatives are latching on to that for their work and personalities. We&rsquo;re not always well-dressed, with ironed clothes, hair brushed or beards trimmed. Creative work is messy, and when you find creatives who openly acknowledge that, I think we all take a silent sigh of relief that it&rsquo;s not just us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something redeemable about the idea of a place to share work where full-time perfection isn&rsquo;t expected. That&rsquo;s what I think Snapchat offers. Snaps aren&rsquo;t your polished portfolio of creativity, and that&rsquo;s OK. Arguably, it&rsquo;s even needed.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>[1] As a consultant for my college writing center, I saw an alarming number of students come in with the idea that the quality of their first draft was an indicator of their writing ability. No. It&rsquo;s going to take 10 revisions before you&rsquo;ve got something that resembles good. The faster you accept this idea, the faster words will get on the page.</p>
<p>[2] Another trend I&rsquo;ve noticed, which deserves a separate article, is designers doing a live-stream of their work. This bears a similarity to Snapchat in that the premise of the experience is messy. Viewers get to see the mistakes, erasing, deleting. Seeing that isn&rsquo;t only expected, but also the most enjoyable part of these broadcasts.</p>

      <h2>Freeing Springboard</h2>
      <p>Would this work?</p>
<p><em><img src="/assets/images/iphone-6-springboard.jpg" alt="Would this work"></em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple change, but the perceived value is immediate. You can put icons anywhere on the existing grid, eliminating the need to <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/10/15/blank-icon-slots/">implement hackery</a> just to make apps easier to launch. In fact, the current (forced) top-to-bottom, left-to-right layout of the iOS Springboard is one of the reasons I find less appeal in the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screens.</p>
<p>I know Reachability sort of helps, but forcing users to make three taps to open an app (two for Reachability and one for the app itself) is less than ideal. An argument can be made that this is the tradeoff you make when choosing a larger screen, but  is this a compromise that needs to be made at all? Android has been implementing a &ldquo;free&rdquo; type of home screen layout for years, and I think it works particularly well for increasing usability across large devices.</p>
<p>Since the iPhone&rsquo;s introduction seven years ago, the iOS Springboard has remained largely unchanged, and, as a programmer, I know that this type of &ldquo;simple&rdquo; change could be a logistical nightmare to implement. However, Apple has always done particularly well at using software design to mitigate constraints imposed by hardware. If the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the sizes Apple wants to commit to for the future, I think Springboard should grow up some too.</p>

      <h2>My next Three Books</h2>
      <p>I recently had the opportunity to pick up three books that I had been meaning to buy. I&rsquo;ve rented and borrowed copies of these titles before, but I&rsquo;m happy to finally own them for myself:</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/081296389X"><em>The New York Times Manual of Style</em></a> — If you&rsquo;re trying to do serious blogging, you should be keeping a personal style guide. Style guides are incredibly useful because they help keep your writing consistent. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like the serial comma or if you spell website as two words, just make your <a href="/style-guide">editorial decisions consistent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/020530902X"><em>The Elements of Style, by Strunk and White</em></a> — This book offers a wide variety of practical and technical tips on writing and grammar. I&rsquo;ve seen this title referenced plenty of times throughout my college writing days, and, as a writer, I&rsquo;m almost a little embarrassed that it has taken this long for me to obtain my own copy.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0131103628"><em>The C Programming Language, by Kernighan and Ritchie</em></a> — What <em>The Elements of Style</em> is to writing, <em>The C Programming Language</em> is to programming. Kernighan and Ritchie&rsquo;s book on the venerable C language is legendary for it&rsquo;s pragmatic approach to programming. In addition to being a great reference, this book will also help me to acquaint myself with the &ldquo;low level&rdquo; technology stack, the fundamental base that powers most, if not all, computing devices.</p>

      <h2>Wabi-sabi</h2>
      <p>Through an odd series of events, which I will expand on another time, I went from owning an iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6 to my current iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Before this rapid iPhone transition, I had stayed on the near-cutting edge of iPhone releases. I liked owning the newest thing out of Cupertino, and every time I got the upgrade, I would tell myself that <em>this</em> was the last one I needed for the next five years. However, it wouldn&rsquo;t be more than six months, before I began imagining myself with the, then still rumored, next iPhone.</p>
<p>What a treadmill. It makes me somewhat sick to think about the amount of time that I&rsquo;ve spent reading Apple rumor blogs, speculating about what my &ldquo;next&rdquo; thing was going to be. The line between tech enthusiasm and unhealthy consumer lusting became increasingly blurred.</p>
<p>So, you can imagine my surprise, as I upgraded, and then double-downgraded to the iPhone 5. At the time, in my mind, this setup would only be for a week, until I could get another iPhone 6. However, day after day, a week turned into four months.</p>
<p>How and why are fair questions to ask, and I&rsquo;ve spent some time trying to figure out the answers. However, after stumbling back across Remy Labesque&rsquo;s <a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/aged-to-perfection.html">Aged to Perfection</a> post, I realized why I was uncharacteristically OK with my current phone.</p>
<p>The Japanese concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</a> is the world view of embracing the wear and tear of everyday things — of finding beauty in the natural aging process. Wabi-sabi directly contradicts our yearly tech upgrade cycle, but in turn, it gives a unique, very natural sense of peace, as our things become increasingly battered.</p>
<p>My iPhone 5 reflects the experiences of a full life. Scratches on the back aluminum, dents along the chamfered edge, and a slight discoloration of the rear Apple logo serve as a permanent reminder of the life I&rsquo;ve lived so far with this rectangular slab of glass in my pocket.</p>
<p>It may sound incredibly conceited or #FirstWorldProblem-ish for me to write that I can manage with &ldquo;just&rdquo; an iPhone 5, and I concede to that interpretation. However, with that concession, I&rsquo;m going to use this opportunity to encourage you to take a moment and contemplate where your own line of consumerism / enthusiasm lies. If you can&rsquo;t find it, there is a chance that you&rsquo;ve merged both doctrines into one easily-defendable lifestyle, which reinforces itself with every upgrade. That was me, anyhow.</p>
<p>My iPhone will, eventually, have to be replaced. However, until then, I remain pleasantly surprised in the amount of joy I get from seeing the aesthetic imperfections. Joy that, mind you, far exceeds anything I&rsquo;ve felt while peeling plastic film off a mint-condition device.</p>

      <h2>On Budgeting</h2>
      <p>At its core, budgeting is setting aside money from each paycheck to go towards a specific goal or <em>category</em> of expenses. That&rsquo;s it. You get paid, you give those dollars a job, and then you only spend whatever you have saved for a particular category. To give you an idea of what this looks like, here are some of the categories that my wife and I have set up for our budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating out</li>
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>Car fuel</li>
<li>Car repairs</li>
<li>Fun (movies, clothing, apps)</li>
<li>Cell phones</li>
<li>Internet</li>
<li>Summer vacation 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the mixture of month-to-month (eating out, groceries, fun) and long-term (summer vacation, car repairs) expenses. Also think about how bills (cell phones, internet) will be relatively consistent from month-to-month, while things like car repairs can vary in cost.</p>
<h2 id="categorizing-transactions">Categorizing transactions</h2>
<p>The first step for any good budget is to figure out what you&rsquo;re currently spending money on. To do this, it helps to group your transactions into categories.</p>
<h3 id="master-categories">Master categories</h3>
<p>All of your categories should fall under one of the three following &ldquo;master categories.&rdquo; Although grouping transactions into categories is useful, it helps to group those categories together, based on whether they&rsquo;re things you <em>have</em> to pay or not. Here&rsquo;s what we currently use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed costs</strong> — These are things that you have to pay for every month, like a cell phone bill or groceries, and the cost is relatively consistent month-to-month. This is also the master category for things that you have to pay for in a lump sum. Think about a six-month car insurance premium. If you know that in six months you&rsquo;ll need to pay $600 to Geico, you can set aside $100 every month for this purpose. When it&rsquo;s time to pay, you just pay it; no scrambling for cash.</li>
<li><strong>Discretionary costs</strong> — These are the general things that you pay for each month, but that you&rsquo;re not obliged to buy. This master category accounts for things like going to the movies, your new hoodie, or going out to eat. The categories here are flexible, because you can reduce how much you spend each month, without missing important payments.</li>
<li><strong>Rainy day</strong> — These are long-term expenses and things that you want to save for. An example: Christmas gifts are expensive, and you may not think about saving for them during the spring and summer. However, by tossing $10 into the Gifts category every month, you&rsquo;ll have $120 to spend, come December!</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are some categories that go into these master ones? Here&rsquo;s what my wife and I have been using for the past several months:</p>
<h3 id="fixed-costs">Fixed costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Car fuel</li>
<li>Car lease</li>
<li>Car insurance</li>
<li>Electric</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>Internet</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Rent</li>
<li>Rent insurance</li>
<li>Student loan</li>
<li>Subscriptions</li>
<li>Tithing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discretionary-costs">Discretionary costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charity</li>
<li>Eating out</li>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Medical</li>
<li>School + Work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rainy-day">Rainy day</h3>
<ul>
<li>Car repair</li>
<li>Buffer*</li>
<li>Gifts</li>
<li>Vacation</li>
<li>Nest Egg™**</li>
</ul>
<p>No two budgets will be the same, but I think that the above categories are a good start for anyone who is relatively fresh out of college. Two special notes for our Buffer and Nest Egg™ categories:</p>
<p><strong>Buffer</strong> — The Buffer is just that: a special slush-fund to put any &ldquo;extra&rdquo; money in.  Think of it as a liquid-able savings account. The Buffer is nice, because it allows us to have a little wiggle room, if we ever go over in a particular category. For us, we&rsquo;re trying to get our Buffer to the point where we have a month&rsquo;s worth of funds inside.</p>
<p><strong>The Nest Egg™</strong> — The Nest Egg is really just a placeholder for our long-term savings account. There is only one rule with the Nest Egg: you never, ever, touch the money inside. It&rsquo;s the first category that we put money into, and it will be the last one we take money out of, which is why the Buffer is useful. The Nest Egg just sits there and grows. We&rsquo;re trying to put a solid 15-20% of our income into the Nest Egg, and it&rsquo;s already surprised me at how large it has grown after just six months.</p>
<h2 id="credit-cards">Credit cards</h2>
<p>When talking about a budget, it&rsquo;s important to talk about credit cards. These little pieces of plastic make it easy to swipe and click our money away, but budgeting can help keep you out of credit card debt. Forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple: no matter where your money is located (credit card, savings account, checking account), you stick to your budget. Your budget is based on your income, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you spend $20 on clothing with your credit card or a check. You&rsquo;re only spending money that you intentionally set aside, which safeguards you from ever overspending.</p>
<h2 id="spending-money">Spending money</h2>
<p>When cash was more prevalent, a great way to budget was to have physical envelopes with the names of each category on them.  Whenever you got paid, you would then take that paycheck and divvy it up between the envelopes. When an envelope was empty, so was that category. I don&rsquo;t see myself ever using this sort of system, but I know a few people who do (notably, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/07/on-working-from-home-and-running-a-business/">Shawn Blanc</a>).</p>
<p>For me — and a decent percentage of my generation, I&rsquo;d wager — managing cash sucks; especially since most employers offer some form of direct deposit. For my wife and me, we find it much more convenient to access our money through our debit cards. However, this convenience needs to be kept in check, because it is easy to overspend in a category when you&rsquo;re not dealing with a limited amount of cash.</p>
<h2 id="the-tech-and-apps">The tech and apps</h2>
<p>Over the past 18 months, I&rsquo;ve used a lot of different apps and websites to manage my money. I had used most of <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/favorite-app-managing-personal-finances-budgets/">The Sweet Setup&rsquo;s Apps for Managing Personal Finance</a> before that list existed, and I had even tried tracking everything by hand, in a big notebook. However, the tools I found the most success with were the ones that kept it simple and put the responsibility on me.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to budgeting, I&rsquo;d warn against any sort of app or website that promises to do much of the &ldquo;budgeting&rdquo; for you. More than a bunch of tools and apps, budgeting is a state of mind. Your goal is to become a good steward of your finances. That being said, there are some apps that I&rsquo;ve found fit into this ideology nicely:</p>
<h3 id="ynab">YNAB</h3>
<p>You Need A Budget, affectionately known as YNAB, is a fantastic piece of software, with an even better online community. There are other &ldquo;finance&rdquo; apps out there, but most of them just help you <em>see</em> your spending trends, not curb them.</p>
<p><em>Note: YNAB&rsquo;s mobile apps are free, but they require the desktop app to sync with, which costs $60. College students can <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/2014/ynab-is-now-free-for-college-students/">get it for free</a>(!), but if you&rsquo;re not in college, don&rsquo;t let the price deter you. Using YNAB will help you save that $60 several times over, and it remains the best software investment I&rsquo;ve ever made.</em></p>
<p>YNAB doesn&rsquo;t tie into your bank account, which means that it can&rsquo;t automatically download your transactions. However, I find that this is a blessing in disguise. Being forced to manually enter all my purchases has the same psychological effect as using cash; you play an active role in the transferring of money, rather than a passive one.</p>
<p>YNAB also has some other neat features, like being able to see spending trends over time, which has proved useful in finding areas that we were spending money that we didn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<h3 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h3>
<p>YNAB is great on its own, but my wife and I share the same bank account, which means that there needs to be some way to sync our transactions. Thankfully, YNAB stores all its data in Dropbox. All I had to do (even though my wife and I have different Dropbox accounts) was share the YNAB folder between our two accounts, and everything stays up-to-date.</p>
<h3 id="scanbot">Scanbot</h3>
<p>If you budget for long enough, you&rsquo;ll realize that entering in transactions on the day they occur is much easier than trying to reconcile a long list of line items from a bank statement. To ease this effort, it helps to start asking for receipts.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re anything like me, you have over a decade of experience in abusing and losing receipts. My receipts will end up in coat pockets, car drink holders, and the bottom of my bag before they ever end up on my desk. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a wonderful little app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanbot-document-scanner-qr/id834854351?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10ltSa">Scanbot</a> (affiliate tag), which lets you quickly snap a picture of your receipt, and then it will automagically upload that image to Dropbox. All that&rsquo;s left is to recycle the paper slip and smile.</p>
<h3 id="numbers-excel-or-some-sort-of-spreadsheet">Numbers, Excel, or some sort of spreadsheet</h3>
<p>Categories are great for making sure you don&rsquo;t go over budget, but how do you figure out what the max amount for each category should be? Here&rsquo;s where a good old fashioned spreadsheet comes into play. Using the categories above as a guide, you can map out your total expenses for a month, and then subtract that from your total income. From there, you can tweak the numbers, until you find a plan that fits your saving goals.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s always a little fun to change the <code>income</code> field to $1 million every once in a while.</p>
<h2 id="its-about-you-and-your-money">It&rsquo;s about you and your money</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never created a budget or thought about your finances before, this whole process could seem overwhelming. However, with just a month or two of effort, you&rsquo;ll begin to feel a freedom and confidence that you may have never felt before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it was for me. Over the course of my senior year, I went from dangerously inept with money to, what I feel is, very competent. My wife and I are saving our money, living within our means, and have established a lifestyle that has helped prepare us for any financial storms that may blow our way. I&rsquo;m not an expert by any means, I still have a lot to learn about investments and retirement planning, but I feel well versed in the fundamentals and ready to learn more.</p>
<p>For me, budgeting is a lot like exercise. It&rsquo;s something that, if done a couple times a week, will only help improve your life. I can&rsquo;t promise that budgeting (and learning how to budget) involves less sweat than a 2-mile jog, but at the end, the results are the same: you feel good, your heart rate relaxes, and a sense of accomplishment permeates your day.</p>

      <h2>Typed for Mac</h2>
      <p>OS X does not need another Markdown text editor.</p>
<p>In fact, Macs already ship with the purest Markdown experience available: TextEdit in plain text mode. However, there are a number of alternatives that can make writing Markdown more convenient: iA Writer (and Pro), Byword, WriteRoom, Markdown Pro, Ulysses, LightPaper, and Mou to name a few.</p>
<p>Today, add Realmac Software’s <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/typed">Typed</a> to the list.</p>
<p>There isn’t a lot to distinguish Typed from the other minimalistic Markdown editors. However, there are two features that I appreciate: blank page quotes and the included soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>Blank page quotes</strong> — When opening a blank page in Typed, you are greeted with a quote, from an oft-cited author.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Soundtrack</strong> — Typed ships with eight different music tracks. They’re instrumental, simple, and relaxing.; perfect for writing. If I ever stop using Typed, I’d seriously consider keeping the app open just to have these tracks available.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Do either of these things matter though? Since iA Writer perfected the minimalistic Markdown editor, any new feature in Typed must add unadulterated value. I don’t know if the quotes and soundtrack add $20 worth of value, but I think these features hint at the two pillars of effective composition: 1.) a non-distracting environment, and 2.) a well-read, inspired mind.</p>
<p>For me, the music tracks in Typed remove the track-to-track transition of iTunes (or track-to-ad-to-track of Rdio), while the quotes provide just enough encouragement to handle my mild cases of apathy towards the whole writing craft. It’s a powerful formula.</p>
<p>Yes, all of the above could be replicated with custom playlist and a text file of inspiring anecdotes from writers better than yourself. And, I’d argue, most writers already have both of these things.</p>
<p>However, the longer you write, the more you realize that true moments of inspiration, the few honest seconds of self realization and reflection, are fragile and rare. Typed does its best to protect these ideals, which counts for something.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll type a few more letters into its window.</p>

      <h2>Something Audacious</h2>
      <p>For a while now, I have wanted to stop writing at <a href="http://kyledreger.com">kyledreger.com</a>.</p>
<p>I love writing, and I think it helps me work through my own thoughts. However, I have always wanted to write in a place that didn&rsquo;t scream &ldquo;me.&rdquo; I wanted a place where I could grow the brand beyond myself.</p>
<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<p>This is the web column I want to read. It will feature articles and musings at the intersection of art and technology.</p>

      <h2>Commencement</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;Lifelong Learners,&rdquo; delivered by Kyle Quinn Dreger on May 10, 2014, at the
University of Mount Union. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I78OflS6hWc">Video
recording</a> is also available.</p>
<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, and thank you for coming today. Before we begin, I want to thank
Dr. and Mrs. Giese, members of the Board of Trustees, and all those individuals
who work day-in and day-out at Mount Union, who have helped us get here today.</p>
<p>And I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t thank Mr. Andrew Hawkins, my high school
superintendent, who told made me promise that if I ever were to find myself on a
stage giving a speech as president, to mention his influential life advice. I&rsquo;m
a man of my word. So thank you, Mr. Hawkins.</p>
<p>When I was a child, my mother loved to chop firewood. Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you
have ever chopped firewood before, but there aren&rsquo;t a lot of things about it
that could be categorized as &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; You get sweaty, dirty, and the occasional
splinter. If you don&rsquo;t like bugs, bees, or wood chips in awkward places, you may
want to avoid this particular activity.</p>
<p>However, even in the madness of splitting firewood, wiping sweat, and swinging
an axe, there is a sense of order. Every piece of wood, once split, fits onto
the wood pile, as though it was meant to be there from the beginning. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter whether the log has knots in it or if it has a weird shape; we had faith
that as long as we chopped it, that piece would fit, perfectly, somewhere in our
pile.</p>
<p>As I look at our time here at Mount Union, I have met some of the most
interesting pieces of wood in my life. However, at the end of these four years,
and looking at you all today, I see that we&rsquo;ve all found a place in the Mount
Union pile, building a strong and connected family.</p>
<h2 id="lifelong-learning">Lifelong learning</h2>
<p>However, our educational journey didn&rsquo;t start with Mount Union. For many of us,
it started in pre-school and kindergarten, around 1995. At that time, we were
less concerned with Tom Hanks winning an Oscar for his role in Forrest Gump, or
that Art Modell almost moved the Browns to Baltimore. Instead, we focused on
shapes, colors, and nap time.</p>
<p>Nap time was good.</p>
<p>It was here that we began the first of many years of learning. However, my
childhood education was different from most. I was homeschooled by my mother up
and through almost the entirety of high school. We decided to do homeschooling
because my father worked afternoon shift for his job, and my parents wanted to
make sure that us kids would have as much time together as a family as possible.</p>
<p>This homeschool setup did lead to a very interesting daily schedule. I would
wake up around 9am and slowly greet the day. Do my chores on the farm. Eat some
captain crunch, maybe a waffle, an apple or two, some toast, glass or three of
orange juice, fry up some bacon. Then around 2:30, when Dad went to work, and
most of you were getting off school, we would start. We finally would end around
11:30 when father would get home from work. We then proceeded to stay up until
about 1:30 am, watching sitcoms like Frasier and The West Wing, before going to
sleep to do it all over again.</p>
<p>Ironically, that schedule from homeschool left me well-prepared for the types of
hours my fellow classmates and I tend to stick to.</p>
<p>But what I liked most about homeschooling was that it helped instill a drive for
constant learning. My mother taught me to look at learning, not as a school year
to school year type of endeavor, but as one that was day to day, 365 days a
year. For her, learning never stopped.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a gross example: I mentioned I grew up on a farm, and on this farm
we had the cutest array of animals: we had goats, which were funny; sheep, which
were incredibly stupid; rabbits, chickens, pigeons and a small garden. Now, we
ate not only the vegetables we grew, but also some of the animals &ndash; a normal
farm thing to do. However, the less normal part involved me learning the
reproductive system by looking at the one inside a chicken. My mother would make
it a hands-on anatomy lab. That was my childhood.</p>
<p>But despite that slightly traumatic experience, and my fear of eggs afterwards,
I think this story illustrates that learning can happen even in the most weird,
unexpected places. As we get ready to leave today, we need to hold tight to the
ideology of being a lifelong learner. The diplomas we receive today signify a
milestone, not a finish line. I don&rsquo;t know what the next step is for us, but I
can promise you that the years of momentum we have, the years of learning how to
learn, years of learning how to work with individuals who may frame their entire
beliefs different than we do;
this momentum, coupled with a passion for learning will help carry us through
the difficult times that come.</p>
<hr>
<p>And there will be difficult times ahead. Some of us have even gone through
difficult times already. I went through a particularly difficult time, right
before starting this past senior year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad for me today, because as I stand here talking about the importance of
being a lifelong learner, the woman who taught me this and made it such a
wonderful thing, isn&rsquo;t here. Last year, as some of you may know, my mother
passed away suddenly. And it kills me that she isn&rsquo;t here to see the actual
completion of something we worked so hard for.</p>
<p>My mother passed away four days after I proposed to my fiancée. I went from the
absolute highest moment of my life, to one of the darkest. It&rsquo;s only now, almost
a year later, that I&rsquo;m able to look past some of that grief.</p>
<p>And you want to know the remarkable thing? Even in her death, the memory of my
mother is still teaching me things.</p>
<p>Life is unpredictable. Today, we feel like we are just now beginning our lives
as adults, and we are and that should be exciting. But, classmates, we have each
already lived at least 20 years of life. Two decades, back-to-back. If we&rsquo;re
lucky, according to the World Bank, we have an average of 60 years left. But
we&rsquo;re not promised those. We are not even promised tomorrow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tell you this to make today sad, or scary. I&rsquo;m telling you this, because
my mother would tell you that we need to &ldquo;plan for tomorrow, but live for
today.&rdquo; Help the person in need today. Do the hard thing on your todo list
today. Forgive people today. Hug your parents, today.</p>
<p>While we are on the topic of parents, I want to wish a very happy mother&rsquo;s day
to all the moms out there there tomorrow. And a special happy mother&rsquo;s day to my
future-mother-in, who, although she could never replace my mother, has been an
absolute blessing in my life. And I look forward to when our families will
become one, as my fiancée Emily and I get married this July.</p>
<p>Looking forward to July and future in general, the last thing I want to touch on
is that; classmates, we are about to enter a world that is very populated with
twenty-something year olds who act like children. And during our first year as
fresh-graduates, we are the age-group most at risk for unintentionally becoming
just that. We are going to be learning as we go what it means to be an adult out
of college. But when you have questions, don&rsquo;t get sucked in to letting the
vocal minority of society be the ones who give you answers. Our &ldquo;millennial&rdquo;
generation is often painted and praised as being careless, irresponsible, and
self-centered. But we know that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling us this, because I want to reaffirm that being an adult, being men
and women, doesn&rsquo;t mean that we have to give up our childlike wonder, or our
young at heart attitude towards life. I feasted on EGO waffles this morning in
my underwear while listening to the Disney Frozen soundtrack, and here I am now
giving the class president commencement address. What adulthood does mean is
that we are entering a stage of life where we are now solely responsible for
ourselves. Contrary to much of society&rsquo;s ideology, this responsibility should be
celebrated.</p>
<p>Remember how freeing it was to come to college from high school, and to have
near complete control of the way you spent you time and schedule? Friends, the
next stage of adulthood is equally as freeing, and we get to start today.
Reinvent yourselves, pursue the things you love, and do not let this let this
opportunity to pass quietly by.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>So be loud, and as the doors here open up to the next four years of our lives,
we should happily and joyfully welcome this new responsibility and freedom.
Remember to never stop learning, you can be a student without being in school.
And plan for tomorrow, but live for today. Be mindful of our future, but do not
forget the things that shouldn&rsquo;t wait even another single day to be done.</p>
<p>I miss my mother incredibly much. And with her memory on my mind, I want to
leave you with this thought.</p>
<p>A small, dedicated group of individuals can literally change the world. And
looking back through history, that&rsquo;s all that ever has.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

      <h2>John Gruber Reviews the iPhone 5C and 5S</h2>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re going to read just one review of the new iPhones, Gruber&rsquo;s is the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c">one to check out</a>. It&rsquo;s thorough and hits on the key features most users, not just us nerds, care about. He also makes a heartening comment about the iPhone 5C&rsquo;s plastic build:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It feels slick but not slippery. Feel-wise it’s not too dissimilar from the old 3G and 3GS (both of which I still have sitting here in my office), but it presents a far more premium overall effect than those previous forays into plastic iPhones.</p>

      <h2>PSA: iOS 7 Ships Tomorrow</h2>
      <p>Just a reminder to all my friends and readers that iOS 7 is  <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715240/ios-7-release-date">rolling out tomorrow</a> for all devices. Although I don&rsquo;t know exactly what time it will be available, pushing out any software to nearly 700,000,000 devices is no small task - be patient.</p>
<p>In terms of what to expect, iOS 7 is a large departure from what we&rsquo;re familiar with. However, the new design and underlying philosophy are <em>still</em> founded on consistency and reliability. Give it a week and you&rsquo;ll find yourself subtly delighted with the details.</p>
<p><em>Two good resources to get caught up quickly on what&rsquo;s new in iOS 7 and the overall ideology are <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/">Apple&rsquo;s own page</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/06/ios_7_signature">John Gruber&rsquo;s thoughts</a> after the unveiling at WWDC.</em></p>
<p>iOS 7 is the first step in a brand new direction for Apple, and there will undoubtedly be some issues along the way. However, given the positive feedback I&rsquo;ve seen on Twitter from several developers using iOS 7 full-time, I think it&rsquo;s finally ready for the masses. Apple certainly does.</p>

      <h2>The Best Places for Desktop Wallpapers</h2>
      <p>I keep my Mac&rsquo;s desktop immaculately clean. No icons, hide the Dock, and only the essentials in the Menu Bar. This serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>My desktop is always available as a &ldquo;holding place&rdquo; for files I&rsquo;m currently working on.</li>
<li>I get the full screen to display a beautiful desktop wallpaper.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is a personal preference of mine, but the second is something I think everyone enjoys. Over the years I&rsquo;ve whittled down my wallpaper sources to just two places. Both these websites have fantastic selections for your desktop and also include iOS-cropped versions of whatever image you select - if matching device wallpapers is your thing (it is for me).</p>
<h3 id="interfacelift">InterfaceLift</h3>
<p><a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/any/">InterfaceLift</a> has a constantly-updated catalogue of awesome high-resolution photography. Even better, they automatically detect your screen size and make sure the image is big enough to look sharp, not blurry.</p>
<p>My favorite feature is that any image you click &ldquo;download&rdquo; on opens in a new tab; letting you (in most browsers) right-click and choose &ldquo;set as wallpaper.&rdquo; Done.</p>
<h3 id="john-carey-aka-fiftyfootshadows">John Carey a.k.a. &ldquo;fiftyfootshadows&rdquo;</h3>
<p><a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net">Fiftyfootshadows.net</a> has slowly become one of my favorite websites on the internet. John Carey is not just an amazing photographer, see his posts containing <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/category/desktops/">desktop images</a>, but he&rsquo;s also an extremely thoughtful writer. One of my favorite pieces from him is called <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2013/07/15/the-curse-of-expectation/">The Curse Of Expectation</a> — a poignant piece for today&rsquo;s social photographers. If you have a couple minutes, go ahead and read it. I&rsquo;ll wait right here.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, Carey also has a great wallpaper-related post called the <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2012/09/27/iphone-5-wallpaper-pack/">iPhone 5 Wallpaper Pack</a>, which is exactly what it sounds like: 45 hand-cropped wallpapers for the iPhone 5. (iPhone 4/4S? He&rsquo;s <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2010/08/03/iphone4-retina-wallpaper/">got you covered</a> too.)</p>
<h3 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h3>
<p>Although those two websites mentioned above are where I get 95% of the wallpapers you&rsquo;ll see on my Mac and iPhone, I also check a few other sites from time-to-time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://simpledesktops.com">Simple Desktops</a>: If you like really minimalistic, colorful wallpapers, SD has some of the best.</li>
<li><a href="http://yesterdaywasonly.net">Yesterday Was Only</a>: Unsurprisingly, also by John Carey. However, where Fiftyfootshadows is the curated selection of his photography, YWO is everything else. Not all the images are large enough for a desktop wallpaper, but you can crop them to fit an iPhone pretty well.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://blog.lite.ly">Litely Blog</a>: Images by airplane pilot / photographer, <a href="http://colerise.com">Cole Rise</a>. These images are about the same size as those from YWO, but they&rsquo;re still just fantastic. If you have a smaller screen resolution, you&rsquo;ll be able to use them as-is, but at the very least they look great on a mobile device.</li>
<li>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.twentyfivethree.com/wallpapers/">Bradley Casteneda</a> has some really fantastic wallpapers for your iPhone, iPad, and desktop over on his site. Because all the images are on one page, it can take a little bit to load, but if you love mountain scenery, hang in there — the wait is worth it.</li>

      <h2>The Five C</h2>
      <p>Some thoughts on the new iPhone 5C, and why it&rsquo;s going to be the most popular version Apple&rsquo;s ever sold.</p>
<p>One of my favorite iPhones to hold was the iPhone 3GS. In my opinion, it was one of the best-feeling phones Apple ever made. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t appreciate the luxurious feel ushered in with the iPhone 4, I do. But the 3GS felt like, on an ideological level, the everyman&rsquo;s phone. Something simple, sturdy, and able to take a little abuse while still looking great.</p>
<p><em>(The only phones I&rsquo;ve played with recently which gave me that feeling were the Nokia Lumias; sleek, while still maintaining that functional and durable design. I recommend Andrew Kim&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/nokia-lumia-920">review of the Nokia Lumia 920</a> if you&rsquo;ve never seen what the Lumias look like)</em></p>
<p>The iPhone 5C is a return to that idea. Although I have yet to examine the build quality in person, several people have been impressed. David Pierce for The Verge in their <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4714074/apple-iphone-5c-hands-on-pictures-video">hands-on after the Apple event</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to make a plastic phone, though, this is how to do it. From the cohesive shell to the smooth and glossy back (which did pick up a fair number of fingerprints) the device feels far better than Samsung&rsquo;s or LG&rsquo;s plastic options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And John Gruber in his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/iphone_5c_5c_event">Thoughts and Observations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s plastic, but there&rsquo;s nothing cheap about it. It has a far better fit and finish, and feels way better in your hand, than Apple&rsquo;s previous foray into plastic iPhones, the 3G and 3GS. The 5C feels like a premium product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t dislike the color choices available, I plan on getting the white variant — possibly with a green (Go Sounders!) case.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I like my gear to be [durable, efficient, and simple]({% post_url 2013-09-09-my-gear %}). I feel the iPhone 5C will fit nicely into that culture.</p>

    </article>
  
    <article>
      <h2>The Best</h2>
      <p>After writing about [the gear I use]({% post_url 2013-09-09-my-gear %}), some people asked me how I actually decide what &ldquo;the best&rdquo; stuff is.</p>
<p>In reality, most of what I consider &ldquo;the best&rdquo; is subjective (not everyone likes iOS, but it&rsquo;s worked great for me). However, I do have a philosophy about what makes truly great stuff, and it&rsquo;s derived from a quote by Shawn Blanc - pulled from an article he wrote <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/11/hunting-for-the-best-mirrorless-camera/">while searching for a new camera</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my hunt for the best camera, I&rsquo;ve defined &ldquo;the best&rdquo; as <strong>a rig which will be fun to use while providing results I&rsquo;m proud of at a price I&rsquo;m not embarrassed by.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My own version is similar, but a tad more general. For me, &ldquo;the best&rdquo; is <strong>something functional and efficient that I&rsquo;m proud to use at a price I&rsquo;m not embarrassed to have paid.</strong></p>
<p>That last part is really important and is part of what makes this concept so delightfully practical: it&rsquo;s budget conscious. Sure, I <em>may feel</em> that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Frame-Full-HD-Digital-Camera/dp/B007FGYZFI">Cannon 5D Mark III</a> is &ldquo;the best&rdquo; DSLR camera, but I&rsquo;d never feel comfortable dropping $3,000+ for something that&rsquo;s, for now, a fun hobby of mine.</p>
<p>For me, truly enjoying the gear I buy means being able to avoid 99% of &ldquo;buyers remorse.&rdquo; I have no problem spending a little extra to get something of quality, but keeping an eye on the financial side of things adds longevity to enjoying my gear.</p>

      <h2>My Gear</h2>
      <p><em>Note: Due to moving hosts, my relative image links are breaking. I&rsquo;m working on it.</em></p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/all-the-gear.jpg" alt="all the gear"></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write a &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my gear&rdquo; piece. I&rsquo;m fascinated seeing what other people are using, and I personally have a deep love for the gear I use.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/holding-macbook.jpg" alt="my macbook"></strong></p>
<p>A 13-inch, mid 2013 Macbook Air is my only machine. This is the third Apple laptop that I&rsquo;ve owned, however it is the first that I&rsquo;ve ever purchased directly from Cupertino. Since I got to pick and choose the exact specs I wanted, I ended up with a 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB RAM, and a 256 solid-state drive configuration.</p>
<p>This machine is beautiful. Apple makes the best designed laptop hardware on the planet, and the Macbook Air sets the standard for an ultraportable computer. Between the (lack of) weight, insane battery life, and overall aesthetics, the Macbook Air feels near perfect.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/fieldnotes.jpg" alt="fn"></strong></p>
<p>My first pack of Field Notes was purchased back in 2011. Originally, I was skeptic about carrying around an actual notebook when I always have my iPhone with me, but I&rsquo;ve since found this little notebook indispensable. In addition to being a million times easier to sketch on (something nearly <em>all</em> iPhone note-taking apps lack), I can always pull out a FN notebook during a meeting without suffering the scorn that would accompany getting out a phone. It&rsquo;s polite and classy.</p>
<p>Paired with my trusty Pilot G2 .5mm pens, I don&rsquo;t think there is a more perfect pocket-sized notebook / pen combination. I&rsquo;ve also taken a leaf from <a href="http://instagram.com/p/df2UcblzVx/">John Gruber&rsquo;s book</a> and started numbering the top-right corner of my notebooks as I fill them.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/wallet-and-fn.jpg" alt="my macbook"></strong></p>
<p>A while back, I had a thick, trifold wallet. Then I saw an ad on Twitter for Saddleback Leather and haven&rsquo;t looked back. For just $14, I picked up one of their <a href="http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Classic-Wallet-Sleeve?sc=8&amp;category=87">Leather Wallet Sleeves</a> in &ldquo;Carbon Black&rdquo; and began slimming down what I actually carry day-to-day.</p>
<p>Currently, I have my student ID, debit card, VISA, driver&rsquo;s license, and about $20 in cash sitting snugly in this single piece of leather. What I love most is that my wallet now slides effortlessly into my front pocket, carries only what I need, and looks better over time.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/iphone4.jpg" alt="iphone 4"></strong></p>
<p>My phone of choice is a wonderfully-worn iPhone 4. Although the single core processor is starting to feel a tad slow, this device still feels as good in my hand as it did when I first unboxed it back in February of 2011.</p>
<p>On the software side of things, iOS 6 remains a joy to use. It&rsquo;s a solid operating system and does the basic things exceedingly well. My two qualifications for a great mobile operating system are usability and reliability. The iPhone and iOS have matched those needs perfectly for me.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/goruck-headshot.jpg" alt="goruck headshot"></strong></p>
<p>If I were only able to keep one piece of gear, it would be my <a href="https://www.goruck.com/gear/Details/gr1-black">GORUCK GR1 rucksack</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/goruck.jpg" alt="goruck"></strong></p>
<p>Crafted at the intersection of simplicity, efficiency, and pure grit: the GR1 is the best backpack I have ever used. Built in the USA and put through rigorous testing by way of the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/events/challenge">GORUCK Challenge</a>, I trust this bag to protect both me and my things at all times.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/goruck-and-bike.jpg" alt="all gear"></strong></p>
<p>Lastly, I present my 10-speed Raleigh road bike. Found at a local yard sale for the price of &ldquo;just take it,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve quickly grown fond of [riding all over campus]({% post_url 2013-01-29-bike-ride %}) with it day and night. Sadly, as much fun as road bikes are to ride, they handle incredibly poorly in any form of snow. Come winter, it&rsquo;s back to walking.</p>
<p>For now though, it&rsquo;s fast, functional, and, best of all, costs me nothing in gasoline.</p>
<p><strong><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/all-gear-angled.jpg" alt="all gear"></strong></p>
<p>Over the next year or so, the only piece of gear that I might look to replace would be my iPhone. However, the incentive to upgrade isn&rsquo;t that pressing - I&rsquo;ll still be able to run iOS 7 - and there&rsquo;s a certain amount of joy I get in seeing the character of wear it&rsquo;s accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>The best gear isn&rsquo;t always that which is newest; sometimes it&rsquo;s the gear you know: stories, scars and all.</p>
<p><em>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tayv_12">Taylor Nervo</a> for taking a half-hour to do this little photo shoot with me. She&rsquo;s a great photographer, excellent singer, and fantastic friend. Thanks, T!</em></p>

      <h2>The Curse of Unlimited Data</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m one of the few lucky Verizon customers who still has an unlimited data plan. However, as I begin to look at possible upgrades for my three-year-old iPhone 4, I find myself in the predicament of getting an upgrade without being forced into a capped data plan.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people in my situation only have two real options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy an unsubsidized, relatively-new device, off eBay or Craigslist and activate my number on it.</li>
<li>Upgrade one of our other eligible lines to a new device and then switch that phone to my line.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although option #2 would save me a little money upfront by subsidizing the price of a phone, it would force whichever line we upgraded to lose unlimited data and be locked into a new two-year contract. Option #1 is currently the only upgrade path for me <em>without</em> having to sign a new contract.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I plan on waiting to see what Apple announces at <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/03/apple-announces-special-event-for-september-10/">their September 10th event</a> and then making a decision from there. If they do release a new iPhone(s?), I can at least look forward to a flood of used iPhone 5s hitting eBay and Craigslist; along with a nice little drop in price.</p>

      <h2>Jumping in</h2>
      <p>As part of my senior project, I have the unique opportunity to spend the next semester writing for this website. That&rsquo;s correct, I get to work on my own little web column for school credit - how awesome is that?</p>
<p>Stemming from a deep admiration for the <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s</a> of the world - those who jump in, feet first, to writing full-time for their websites - I&rsquo;m excited to be doing just that for the next fifteen weeks. I hope to emerge a more consistent, quality writer and I look forward to building a relationship with my readers as well.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, I&rsquo;m nervous. Some of my pieces will probably be rough around the edges, and some may never be published. However, even with these fears, I&rsquo;m ready. I want to take my writing to the next level, and I&rsquo;m ecstatic to have the opportunity to do just that. Let&rsquo;s see where these next fifteen weeks take us.</p>

      <h2>Microsoft Arc Touch mouse</h2>
      <p>The time had finally come for my trusty <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-mobile-mouse-3500">Microsoft Wireless 3500</a> to die. For the past two years it had served me well, but the middle button - which had been inconsistent these past few months - finally failed. Given I had only spent $19 on it at a Target Back-to-School sale, I felt it was an opportune time to upgrade.</p>
<p>Off the glowing recommendation of a friend at work, I decided to pick up a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/arc-touch-mouse">Microsoft Arc Touch</a>. $50 is a lot to spend on anything, but I rationalized the purchase by way of a growing awareness to my own &ldquo;hand&rdquo; health. Between work, school and this website, my hands are always working at the computer. In an effort to fight repetitive strain injury (RSI), any keyboard or mouse which can reduce even 5% of my daily hand strain is a worthwhile purchase.</p>
<p>Although expensive, you instantly feel that money at work in the build quality. The svelte, black matte finish feels fantastic in the hand. I had also been in love with the signature curved design ever since the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/arc-mouse">original Arc</a>, and the Touch brought an even slimmer profile by dropping the traditional scroll wheel. Unfortunately, as fantastic as the Arc Touch looks and feels, it becomes downright annoying after bringing up any document taller than your screen.</p>
<p>As I began to scrub my finger down the touch-scroll bar, I felt some subtle, tactile feedback accompanied by a set of computer-sounding beeps. Evidentially, the Arc Touch tries to mimic the physical feedback you get from a traditional scroll-wheel, but this effect backfires considerably. In addition, the Arc Touch also attempts to integrate momentum scrolling, ala OS X, but it&rsquo;s jerky, jarring and, well, complete jank.</p>
<p><em>Note: Even configuring the Arc touch via Microsoft&rsquo;s IntelliPoint drivers and preference pane yields no solution. This is additionally frustrating, because some extra research revealed the Windows driver allows you to one-click toggle the effect.</em></p>
<p>If you use a Mac, the short answer is to not buy this mouse. I ended up returning mine shortly afterwards and swapping it out for a <a href="http://amzn.com/B0082D5660">Logitech Anywhere MX</a>, which I&rsquo;ve been happy with so far.</p>
<p>The Arc Touch is probably a great mouse for Windows users, especially after turning off the touch-scroll bar feedback, but the omission of this option from OS X makes the Arc Touch practically useless to me. Considering the superb build quality, it&rsquo;s truly disappointing that the scrolling mechanics yank the experience so far in the direction of cheap and tacky that no curve can bring it back.</p>

      <h2>A brief review of Vesper</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve tried tens of iOS note-taking applications over the years. Among others, I&rsquo;ve tested Simplenote, Elements, iA Writer, and Notesy, but none were able to evoke the feelings I get when writing something into my <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> notebook. I was looking for <em>delight</em>.</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a>.</p>
<p>Vesper is a different kind of note-taking application under the mantra &ldquo;Collect your thoughts,&rdquo; and developed by three gentlemen all seasoned in apps and design. Named after a <a href="http://goo.gl/9B5pS">cocktail invented by James Bond</a>, Vesper is every bit as subtle and well dressed as Bond himself. I find myself delighted in the simple animations, speed (like butter on my iPhone 4), and execution of concepts like tagging and archiving.</p>
<p>$4.99 may seem steep for a note-taking app with only a handful of features and no syncing, but go read Dave Wiskus&rsquo;s <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/how-to-make-a-vesper/">post on designing Vesper</a> and you&rsquo;ll see just how much effort was put into nailing the details. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m happy to pay for.</p>
<p>At half the cost for a 3-pack of Field Notes, I consider Vesper an investment in how my brain enjoys working. My only concern is the lack of syncing / iCloud backup, however I&rsquo;m certain that&rsquo;s one feature we&rsquo;ll be seeing eventually. If you love Field Notes, skip the grande coffee today and grab a copy of Vesper instead.</p>

      <h2>What matters</h2>
      <p>Family, friends, and the people around you matter. Helping these people matters too. One of the ways I try to help people is through creating software.</p>
<p>But software is only useful if it helps fix a real problem. As a programmer, it is my implicit job to find problems and break down ways to solve them. Here is where many, myself included, get lost.</p>
<p>I get caught up thinking the problem to be solved is a global one. It would be great if I did find a solution to some world-wide issue, but often my effort spent saving the world comes at the expense of local problems I may have the skills to actually fix.</p>
<p>Stop putting the weight of the world on your shoulders. Make a small <em>real</em> difference in the life of a real person. This is the core of empathetic, impactful software development, but it can be applied to many other disciplines.</p>
<p>In summary: 1) help people. 2) be happy.</p>

      <h2>Social scoreboards</h2>
      <p>I went on a <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/346820510526615553">small rant about social scoreboards</a> the other day and have been thinking about social analytics ever since.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Remember that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/16/ashton.cnn.twitter.battle/index.html">competition to reach a million followers</a> between Ashton Kutcher and CNN? We&rsquo;re mildly obsessed with stats related to us, and sites like Twitter and Facebook make sure to put those numbers where we can see them. Social analytics can be a powerful tool when used as data, but I worry when those numbers start causing change in emotions and actions.</p>
<p>One of the places I&rsquo;ve noticed this affecting me is right here, on my own website.</p>
<p>For a couple years I&rsquo;ve run Google Analytics behind-the-scenes to record the number of visitors and page-views this site has generated. It&rsquo;s been fun to publish a piece and then check the realtime stats, but there hasn&rsquo;t ever been any <strong>real</strong> reason to do this. I don&rsquo;t write that often, no page-view reliant revenue is being generated, and the numbers aren&rsquo;t anything incredibly substantial. Yet I would check them. Every. Time.</p>
<p>Even though GA doesn&rsquo;t cost any money to run, it&rsquo;s quietly put emotional tariffs on every piece I&rsquo;ve published; subtlety tying the joy of writing to the number of eyeballs that read it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a tax I want to pay anymore, and I&rsquo;ve decided to remove any analytics that previously monitored this site. When I write here, I want to take as much joy from the experience as possible. By removing the ability to see who&rsquo;s reading, I&rsquo;ve given myself back the ability to write freely - regardless who sees it.</p>

      <h2>URLs for Email</h2>
      <p>This morning I read an interesting article by Jared Erondu titled <a href="http://blog.jarederondu.com/if-emails-worked-like-urls">If Emails Worked Like URLs</a>. His idea revolves around the notion of prematurely assigning subfolders to an email message based on the addressed it was sent to. In his example, sending an email to <code>john@johndoe.com/hire</code> would automatically sort the email into a folder/label named &ldquo;hire.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As he noted in his post, Gmail already lets you do something like this. For instance, messages sent to <code>johndoe@gmail.com</code> and <code>johndoe+hire@gmail.com</code> all go to the same inbox where you could then use a filter to tack on a corresponding label. However, where Erondu&rsquo;s idea jumps miles ahead of Gmail&rsquo;s +tag syntax is this simple fact: you don&rsquo;t change the core email address.</p>
<h3 id="tagging-makes-a-unique-address">Tagging makes a unique address</h3>
<p>Online services treat Gmail&rsquo;s email+tag syntax as unique email addresses. That means that <code>john+social@gmail.com</code>, <code>john+hire@gmail.com</code> and <code>john+personal@gmail.com</code> are all <strong>unique addresses</strong> in the eyes of the database. This creates a problem when it comes to remembering which email you used to sign up for any given account. Even though all the emails come to <code>john@gmail.com</code>, trying to log in with that address will get you nowhere. Of all the times I&rsquo;ve switched friends and family to Gmail, I&rsquo;ve never mentioned the +tag feature for this reason - no need for extra confusion.</p>
<p>Erondu&rsquo;s solution is more elegant. An online service could easily regex the core email address for log in, and then tag on the subfolder when emails had to be sent out. This way, regardless whether you&rsquo;re signing in to Facebook or Apple, your core email address will always get you in. It&rsquo;s simple, and users don&rsquo;t have to remember anything extra.</p>
<p>Kudos, Jared for coming up with a slick idea - you&rsquo;re a smart man. It may hold more promise than you think.</p>

      <h2>I am a remix</h2>
      <p>99% of what you create in life is <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/">a remix</a> of someone else&rsquo;s work. Enjoy the fact you didn&rsquo;t have to start from scratch. Isacc Newton put it succinctly, &ldquo;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The design I&rsquo;ve created here is a remix - one based on a decade&rsquo;s worth of inspiration from all corners of the web. Hat tips to <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>, <a href="http://galengidman.com">Galen Gidman</a>, the <a href="http://svbtle.com">Svbtle Network</a> and <a href="http://informationarchitects.net/blog/">Information Architects</a> just to name a few.</p>
<p>How I approach tomorrow will be a remix of how I approached today - taking what I&rsquo;ve learned in the past 24 hours to alter and refine my direction in life.</p>

      <h2>Fix your Mount Union .EDU email</h2>
      <p><strong>UPDATE #3:</strong> This whole post is pretty much irrelevant now. Besides the slightly vitriolic nature, the entire Outlook Web App was recently updated to match the aesthetics / functionally of <a href="http://outlook.com">Outlook.com</a> and is incredibly more usable. Post will remain here for posterity.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> I&rsquo;ve found the magical URL which only makes you sign in once: <a href="http://outlook.com/owa/mountunion.edu">outlook.com/owa/mountunion.edu</a>. Just bookmark that and you&rsquo;ll be good to go.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I simplified the instructions for those looking to set up your mobile email <em>without</em> the required passcode. More instructions under the &ldquo;IMAP and POP clients&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>This past week, my iPhone&rsquo;s email just stopped working. It wasn&rsquo;t long before many of my friends began complaining of similar problems. I knew that somewhere, a switch was flipped and the new Mount Union email system was finally set loose.</p>
<p>Students of Mount Union - our webmail has changed. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s taken a turn for the worse. While the increase in storage is nice, it&rsquo;s overshadowed by a terrible, terrible, user experience.</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong>: An upgrade in space from 30 MB to just under 25 GB and lifelong @mountunion.edu access.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong>: Being forced to sign in <strong>twice</strong> on webmail.mountunion.edu.</p>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong>: Broke existing mobile clients without telling us how to fix them, and the new webmail interface is a complete cluster.</p>
<p>Though the underlying technology took a step forward, we&rsquo;ve taken five <em>usability</em> steps back. Overrun by a terrible color palette, unnecessary gradients and shadows, and unpredictable rendering - the new interface is a complete user experience failure. The old interface wasn&rsquo;t great, but at least it was simple and usable.</p>
<p>Adding sprinkles to this cupcake from the netherworld, many of us who had set up Exchange on our smartphones and tablets had the entire system just stop working. <em>Forcing</em> us to the webmail client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only good thing about the change is we have more space.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous Student</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly 2,200 students use Mount&rsquo;s email daily. By the end of this post I hope we can fix your existing setup, give you a way to avoid the webmail interface completely, and start enjoying email again.</p>
<h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
<p>To get started, scroll down to the section of instructions that applies to you. If everything else fails, take the Reference Instructions below and head to Google. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=imap+setup+for+myclient">already created a search for you</a>, just replace &ldquo;myclient&rdquo; with the name of the application you are trying to set up.</p>
<p>Good luck, friend.</p>
<h3 id="reference-instructions">Reference Instructions</h3>
<p>These settings will be referenced in the sections that follow as we set up new email clients, and fix your existing one.</p>
<pre><code>POP setting
Server name: pod51008.outlook.com
Port: 995
Encryption method: SSL

IMAP setting
Server name: pod51008.outlook.com
Port: 993
Encryption method: SSL

SMTP setting
Server name: pod51008.outlook.com
Port: 587
Encryption method: TLS
</code></pre>
<p>You can also just hand this information to one of your technically-inclined friends, and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll know what to do with them.</p>
<h3 id="fix-your-smartphone-or-tablet">Fix your smartphone or tablet</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> One of the new rules of setting up your mobile device with access to Mount&rsquo;s Exchange email server is that you <strong>must have Passcode Lock on your device</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t have one set (a 4-digit key to unlock your phone / tablet), you will be prompted to create one after finishing the Exchange setup. While I recommend setting one for general security, if you <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to be forced to unlock your phone, skip down &ldquo;IMAP and POP clients&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="ios-exchange">iOS Exchange</h4>
<p>For the iOS devices, it&rsquo;s as simple as removing (then re-adding) your email account.</p>
<pre><code>Homescreen &gt; Settings.app &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars
</code></pre>
<p>Select your Mount Union account.</p>
<pre><code>*Scroll to bottom* &gt; Delete Account
</code></pre>
<p><code>Confirm</code> the delete and wait for it to finish removing your account. Once it&rsquo;s done, go back to <code>Mail, Contacts, Calendars</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Add Account... &gt; Microsoft Exchange
</code></pre>
<p>Enter in your full <code>Email</code>, <code>Password</code> and give the <code>Description</code> something like &ldquo;School&rdquo;. Once you&rsquo;re done, click <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>If you get a &ldquo;Cannot verify server identity&rdquo; popup, just click <code>Continue</code>. If you&rsquo;ve entered all your credentials in correctly, you should see everything verify with a checkmark. You can then resume using your email as usual.</p>
<h4 id="android-exchange">Android Exchange</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have an Android device to test with. However, I anticipate the course of action being similar to iOS. Simply remove your existing Mount Union email account from the device, then re-add it back. <strong>Note</strong> that with Android Exchange, you may have to set your username in the form of <code>campus\yourusername</code>.</p>
<p>If you have trouble setting up Exchange, jump down to the &ldquo;IMAP and POP clients&rdquo; section for general instructions which should work for you.</p>
<h3 id="fix-your-computer">Fix your computer</h3>
<p>Most of you probably access webmail.mountunion.edu through a web browser like Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer. However, having a standalone <em>client</em> to handle your email will be a faster, and overall better, experience.</p>
<p>There are tens of email clients available for the Mac and PC, but I&rsquo;m just going to walk you through instructions setting up the default clients that come pre-installed on your machine. Macs have Mail.app, and PCs have Windows Mail.</p>
<h4 id="mac-mailapp">Mac Mail.app</h4>
<p>Setting up Mail.app is pretty straightforward. I&rsquo;m using OS X 10.8.2, so these instructions are for the latest version of Mail.app, but they should be the same for most cases.</p>
<pre><code>System Preferences.app &gt; Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars
</code></pre>
<p>Click on <code>Microsoft Exchange</code> and enter in your <code>Name</code>, full <code>Email Address</code> and <code>Password</code>. You may get a &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t verify the identity of the server&rdquo; popup, but just click <code>Continue</code> when it comes up.</p>
<p>Once it finds your account, click <code>Continue</code> and select the services you want set up. I usually uncheck all the boxes except for Mail and Contacts. Click <code>Add Account</code>. Go open up Mail.app and you should see your mail begin to download. Now whenever you want to check / write an email, just open Mail.app.</p>
<h4 id="windows-mail">Windows Mail</h4>
<p>Setting up Windows Mail is slightly less straightforward, you need the Reference Instructions from above, but it&rsquo;s pretty easy nonetheless. If this is your first time opening Windows Mail, I suggest this <a href="https://wiki.sonic.net/wiki/Windows_Mail_IMAP_Settings">excellent tutorial from Sonic.net</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Windows Mail &gt; Tools menu &gt; Accounts
</code></pre>
<p>Click <code>Add</code>, and then select <code>E-mail Account</code> as the type of account you wish to add. Click <code>Next</code>. Use the information from the Reference Instructions above to complete the setup. Make sure to use IMAP server setting for your <code>Incoming mail</code> and the SMTP server settings for <code>Outgoing e-mail</code>.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to test these instructions, however in addition to the Sonic.net tutorial, I also found the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Mail-setting-up-an-account-from-start-to-finish">official Microsoft instructions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-imap-and-pop-clients">General IMAP and POP clients</h3>
<p>Enter the Reference instruction information from above. For specific instructions, I recommend that you head to Google. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=imap+setup+for+myclient">already created a search for you</a>, just replace &ldquo;myclient&rdquo; with the name of the application you are trying to set up.</p>
<h4 id="ios-passcode-less-email">iOS Passcode-less email</h4>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure you have your Wi-Fi turned OFF before doing the following steps. You can turn off Wi-Fi by going to Settings.app.</p>
<pre><code>Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account...
</code></pre>
<p>Select <code>Other</code> from the bottom of the list, then choose to <code>Add Mail Account</code>. Here, enter you <code>Name</code>, <code>Email</code> and <code>Password</code> - just choose something like &ldquo;School&rdquo; for the <code>Description</code>.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Incoming Mail Server&rdquo;, enter <code>pod51008.outlook.com</code> as the <code>Host Name</code>, and enter your <strong>full</strong> @mountunion.edu email address under <code>User Name</code>. Do the exact same thing for &ldquo;Outgoing Mail Server&rdquo; as well.</p>
<p>Your mail should now work. Remove the old Mount Union account, and feel free to turn OFF your Passcode lock.</p>
<h4 id="android-passcode-less-email">Android Passcode-less email</h4>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tested the Android set up, but <a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/email/mobile/android-imap.html">this tutorial from UCSanDiego</a> has great pictures and instructions for setting up IMAP on Android.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h3>
<p>Hopefully one of the above instructions worked for you. If not, I&rsquo;d recommend taking your email client and laptop / phone / tablet down to Mount&rsquo;s IT department and having them set it up for you. If you have any comments, corrections or questions, feel free to <a href="/colophon">shoot me an email</a>. Cheers, everyone.</p>

      <h2>The Tinkerer</h2>
      <p>I want to tell you about the Tinkerer.</p>
<p>The Tinkerer was a good web designer, a good programmer and a good writer. But having things come easy to him eventually led to trouble.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Creative was his mind, that he started dozens of small projects - though few ever saw completion. Hours were spent tweaking the colors, and fonts on his website. At first, this could be seen as an admirable dedication to the details, but in reality it was a vacuum for the any spare time he had.</p>
<p>Time ran short. Studying, sleep and showers were being cut to make up the difference. Days felt longer as a tired mind moves more slowly. I&rsquo;ll go to bed early tonight, the Tinkerer would say, only to succumb to allure of making one last midnight change to some code.</p>
<p>The Tinkerer became overwhelmed. Side projects never finished felt like anchors weighing him down. Hard deadlines for real work approached with each day. A moment of clarity led him to realize that change was necessary.</p>
<p>But old habits die hard. The Tinkerer was addicted to the high that came with a new project. The possibility that <em>this one</em> was going to change everything. But this fallacy, parading under the illusion of fruitful work, was costing him more than he had realized.</p>
<p>The Tinkerer has work ahead of him, but not in the usual sense. Rather, he has to learn that things are OK the way they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>That there are only so many hours in a day.</li>
<li>That the real world is where the people are.</li>
<li>That a small, finished product of quality outweighs five large, incomplete ones.</li>
<li>That sleep is essential to a healthy mind, body and soul.</li>
<li>That for everything he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to, he&rsquo;s really saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to something else.</li>
<li>That identity comes from God, and not the color of his links.</li>
</ul>
<p>That true joy can be found in fruitful work. Focused, quality work. Resulting in a product representative of the time it took to create, and the care with which is was crafted.</p>

      <h2>Trash</h2>
      <p>My mom gave me eyes, a nose and terrible knees. If my genetic history is to be taken seriously, around 40 years old I won&rsquo;t be able to hit the streets for a run anymore. And that sucks.</p>
<p>Because I <strong>love</strong> running on pavement. The subtle, muted drum of my Nike shoes on the ground warrants days I run without an iPod. I love the quiet, exercise and time to think.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I got to mile four out of five on my latest run, I noticed two soda cans on the side of the road. I usually run right by these things, who wants to carry trash as they run, but this time I got the smallest voice in my head saying to pick them up. Annoyed that this was really happening, I turned around and jogged back to pick up the cans, then continued on my run.</p>
<p>20 yards later, I found an old milk container. The top had been chopped off, and it was laying in a ditch. The road wrapped around the corner to the left, near a pretty dangerous turn, so I knew no one would come by to pick it up anytime soon. Last time, I told myself, mostly because I didn&rsquo;t want this to turn into a recurring theme - I was on a run after all. But, I leaned over and scooped up the container, stuffed the pop cans through the chopped-off top, and continued on.</p>
<p>Three hills before my house, I came across a drenched 6-pack cardboard box, whose bottles were staggered for the next 30 yards. I told the little voice in my head to go bother someone else. Sorry God, I said. I <em>would</em> pick those up, really, but my hands are full, and I only have another half mile to go. I&rsquo;d come back another day, I told myself, and get the box and bottles I had missed. I had picked up all I could carry, but now it was time to finish a run.</p>
<p>Then, I found a bag.</p>

      <h2>Oreo</h2>
      <p>My girlfriend and I talk frequently about spiritual things. We talk about the Bible. We talk about Jesus and His life. Mostly, however, we talk about using God to strengthen our relationship, and help each other grow. We&rsquo;re not perfect by any means, but I&rsquo;m really blessed to have someone as God-centered as she is.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While talking a couple weeks ago, we found ourselves on the topic of us and our relationship with Him. A couple of days focused on each other, and not enough on our spiritual health, left us feeling like we weren&rsquo;t clicking as usual. It was here that I stumbled onto a delicious little analogy that summarizes the sort of relationship we&rsquo;re striving for. Milk&rsquo;s favorite cookie, the Oreo.</p>
<p>The analogy goes like this: imagine my girlfriend and I as the cookie parts of an Oreo, and God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit as the creamy, delicious filling. If it were just us two cookies, there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything to hold us together; we would easily fall apart. However, when you put creamy-center God into the equation, the cookies stick together quite well. Only by holding on for dear cookie life to God can we stay connected, forever, with each other.</p>
<p>This analogy really works for us. Probably because we&rsquo;re half crazy, but also because there&rsquo;s some real truth in there. Whenever we feel a little off, or just need some encouragement, one of us will text the other &ldquo;Oreo,&rdquo; and it helps us refocus on what really makes &ldquo;us&rdquo; work. Loving Jesus truly makes you a better lover, and I&rsquo;m sure if He could have tried one, our Lord probably would have loved Oreos too.</p>

      <h2>GORUCK GR1 Delivered</h2>
      <p>My GORUCK GR1 arrived today.</p>
<p>I want to write a longer review after I get done dragging it through Georgia next week, but here are some quick impressions:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Damn this is a nice bag. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;8″, weigh around 150 and this bag fits great. My previous Radio Ruck was a good fit, but the GR1 really hugs my body with all my gear in it.</li>
<li>The GR1 can fit a ton, the pockets are deep and the slightly angled bottom keeps the weight higher on my back. I needed some extra space, and it delivers.</li>
<li>It looks great. Any color, so long as it&rsquo;s black.</li>
<li>After just a couple hours, you can tell this bag exudes quality. Every detail was thought out, and anything that wasn&rsquo;t needed was cut out. This leaves you with a minimalistic piece of gear that performs at a high level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only having it a few hours, I&rsquo;m not afraid to say this is the last bag I will ever buy. The Radio Ruck will be great for a lot of people, but for my college student athlete needs, and a love of traveling, this bag is perfect.</p>

      <h2>Market share</h2>
      <p>I was speaking with my father this morning around 2:00 AM and somehow we got on the topic of WWDC.</p>
<p>My father is not as savvy as I when it comes to computer technology, however he holds his own amongst his peers. As I was explaining Apple&rsquo;s newest flagship laptop, the Macbook Pro Retina, I could see him grimacing as I explained the lack of upgrade options and removal of an optical drive. “They eliminate a lot of customers by doing that,” he said. “At some point, you&rsquo;re going to start cutting into how much market share you can really get when you remove things people need, by trying to make everything thinner and lighter.”</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The new Macbook Pro Retina is <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/opinion-apple-retina-displa/">not meant to be taken apart</a>. In order to make it as thin and light as it is, almost everything is either soldiered or glued together. iFixIt&rsquo;s crew even gave it a terribly low 1/10 Repairability Score (10 being the easiest to repair).</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how Apple actually approaches their business. And the conclusion I came to is that Apple doesn&rsquo;t base their decisions around “market share” when it comes to hardware. Let that sink in for a moment. We&rsquo;re not talking about iOS or Mac OSX, where they do want as much market share as possible, we&rsquo;re talking about when Apple builds a new-category type of product.</p>
<p>Several times throughout the Macbook Pro Retina video, Apple executives talked about letting go of the past as a way to create for the future. That&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;ve done with the new Macbook Pro. They don&rsquo;t care if it works for everyone, but what they do care about is making the thinnest and most powerful, high resolution laptop in the world; eventually having those features trickle down into their full product line.</p>
<p>I imagine that as Jony Ive works on the next version of the iPhone, Mac Pro and iPad, he&rsquo;s not making products that will be the most “market share” friendly. He&rsquo;s making products that will drive Apple forward, and pull the rest of the industry behind it.</p>

      <h2>Left out</h2>
      <p>After a few more days with the iOS 6 beta, it&rsquo;s still going pretty well. Now that I&rsquo;ve had more time to experiment with it, I&rsquo;ve begun to notice the bugs that are still there. Nothing groundbreaking, but more than I had first, hopefully, assumed there were.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In my earlier post on iOS 6, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>iOS 6 doesn&rsquo;t have anything I&rsquo;ve seen, Passbook and Maps aren&rsquo;t active yet, that makes me go “WOW.” But there are hundred of small improvements that just made the phone in your pocket get substantially better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of that still true. However, I recently read over on <a href="http://apple.com/ios/ios6/">Apple&rsquo;s page for iOS 6</a> that for some of us, the cool turn-by-turn and 3D flyover will never turn on. Found on the bottom of the page as a footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some features may not be available in all countries or all areas. Flyover and turn-by-turn navigation will be available only on iPhone 4S and iPad 2 or later. Cellular data charges may apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disappointing. I can understand that you may need more power for the 3D Flyover, but leaving the 4 out of turn-by-turn directions? That&rsquo;s pretty weak. Thankfully, MapQuest actually has a really good, free <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mapquest/id316126557?mt=8">turn-by-turn navigation app</a> that works like a charm on the 4. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Reading deeper into the fine print, you&rsquo;ll notice that there two other footnotes that are especially harsh to 3GS users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shared Photo Streams requires iOS 6 on iPhone 4 or later or iPad 2 or later, or a Mac computer with OS X Mountain Lion. An up-to-date browser is required for accessing shared photo streams on the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently pushing photos over a network and adding another album to the camera roll are too much. Okay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VIP list and VIP and Flagged smart mailboxes will be available on iPhone 4 or later and iPad 2 or later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two small enhancements to Mail, and the 3GS is left out. This one in particular really seems to be a ploy to get users upgrading their devices.</p>
<p>Now, there is the other side of me that says the 3GS was announced way back in June 8, 2009. It will be getting the iOS 6 update, but left out of some cool features to encourage users to upgrade their device. That&rsquo;s a three year old device, which will still get the latest software update from Apple. Compare this with the Android market, and you have phones that are being sold with operating systems several years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad the 4 and 3GS are being left out of some cool features needlessly. I&rsquo;m happy that my iPhone will be able to run the latest OS for a couple years now. But, I understand that Apple is a business.</p>
<p>Just give me my dang Maps, okay?</p>

      <h2>New cleats</h2>
      <p>Short one today. I got my new soccer cleats today - Adidas Predator Absolions. I use to wear Predators all the time when I was younger, but once I got into my sophomore year of high school, I switched to Pumas. Ever since then, I had bought the same pair of Puma shoes off eBay, or wherever I could find them; they were the perfect size and fit. However, after all these years, it&rsquo;s finally time to return and give adidas another go.</p>
<p>So far, I love having a little more protection on my feet – I tend to get stepped on a lot, and the Predators have a little more padding than the Pumas – and the touch is nice and soft. I&rsquo;m looking forward to breaking them in.</p>

      <h2>WWDC 2012</h2>
      <p>WWDC. I wait all year for this. It&rsquo;s on my bucket list of events I want to attend. As someone joked on Twitter, it&rsquo;s the event where Apple-lovers find out what they&rsquo;re getting for Christmas. This also might have been the most important WWDC since Steve Jobs announced the original iPhone. New hardware, new software and an amazing completely redesigned Macbook Pro easily filled the two hours on stage - Jony Ive could <a href="http://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/212237130016104448">wax romantic about the new Macbook Pro to me all day</a>.</p>
<p>As an iOS developer, and someone who actually needs to get some sleep tonight, I am only going to write about some thoughts I have about iOS 6 after watching the keynote and installing the beta on my iPhone. I&rsquo;d love to talk about everything, but time is short, and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/#macbookpro">new Macbook Pro video</a> does way more justice than I ever could without using one of those downright ridiculous new things.</p>
<p>As soon as the Apple Keynote ended today, I pointed my browser to the developer website to download the beta of iOS 6. Although the page was down to begin with, no doubt some preparation for the traffic that was coming, I was able to download and install the latest and greatest software from Cupertino without a problem. In fact, it actually went way more smoothly than last year with iOS 5.</p>
<p>Because this is pre-release software, I&rsquo;m not allowed to go spilling the guts of everything that&rsquo;s new. However, the basic rule of thumb is if they talked about it in the keynote, which is now public, I&rsquo;m fine to speak on it. So, here&rsquo;s my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much, much more stable than iOS 5 was last year in beta. iOS 6 is suitable for your main device. There are going to be bugs sure, but I haven&rsquo;t encountered anything that breaks the usability. If you really want to try the beta, but don&rsquo;t have a dedicated development iDevice, you should be fine using your main device.</li>
<li>iOS got a whole new coat of paint. It feels fresh. There isn&rsquo;t anything groundbreaking in terms of new UI, but the subtle things Apple has done really make it feel alive again. UI Kit was in bad need of an update of some kind, and this one does it without going over the top. I would like to see the new dock style from Mountain Lion make its way into iOS, as well as some tweaking to the gradients that have replaced the &ldquo;gloss&rdquo; effect for title bars.</li>
<li>Maps is going to be great. Unfortunately, most of the cool features, mainly turn-by-turn, aren&rsquo;t turned on yet. As we get to the 2nd and 3rd betas before the final release, I&rsquo;m sure the switches will be flipped, but not yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#passbook">Passbook</a> is going to be a huge deal. This might be the single biggest thing Apple released today for iOS. Again, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not functional yet so I&rsquo;ll have to wait. Nonetheless, this is going to be amazing when it rolls out. From Apple&rsquo;s page:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Your boarding passes, movie tickets, retail coupons, loyalty cards, and more are now all in one place. With Passbook, you can scan your iPhone or iPod touch to check in for a flight, get into a movie, and redeem a coupon. You can also see when your coupons expire, where your concert seats are, and the balance left on that all-important coffee bar card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple is slowing eliminating our need for plastic cards, paper boarding passes and even coupons - all without any new, NFC chip or dongle you attach to the device. Incredible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook is now baked into iOS in almost the exact same way as Twitter was last year. By using the share button found throughout iOS, you can quickly post pictures, text or links to your Facebook profile. What&rsquo;s more, Facebook will sync all your calendars and friend information into your contacts - although, they <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t sync your friends&rsquo; email addresses which is a huge pain in the but.</li>
<li>Polish, polish, polish. iOS 6 doesn&rsquo;t have anything I&rsquo;ve seen, Passbook and Maps aren&rsquo;t active yet, that makes me go &ldquo;WOW.&rdquo; But there are hundred of small improvements that just made the phone in your pocket get substantially better. It says a lot that their beta software, which still won&rsquo;t ship for months, is solid enough for me to use on my primary device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple is continuing to push the market forward with iOS 6. I can&rsquo;t speak to Siri, still rocking the iPhone 4, but the latest version of iOS seems to be off to a good start. As with past betas, there will be a few new things they didn&rsquo;t tell us today that make their way into the final release, but as of now it&rsquo;s pretty darn good. Apple is, at heart, a software company, and it shows. They had the best operating system for a mobile device before, and it&rsquo;s just got even better with this latest update.</p>

      <h2>Starbucks</h2>
      <p>I haven&rsquo;t accomplished much writing today. So, in lieu of staying inside and eating more cereal, I put on jeans and and a belt and drove over to my local Starbucks. In a lot of ways, this coffee shop mirrors my writing. There&rsquo;s not much else I could do here, except write. I can&rsquo;t load up the Xbox, make something to eat, or try and socialize with the roommates down the hall; just write. It suits me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which is why I find myself solo tonight in the local Starbucks. I got here and checked-in with Foursqure, something else I&rsquo;ve really come to appreciate as time has gone on. Being able to look back at my history of check-ins and see where I&rsquo;ve gone has been insightful to my life in general. Dustin Curtis once quipped that Foursquare is the Facebook of the future. I don&rsquo;t know if that is completely true, but the abstracted version of what he&rsquo;s saying is that the future of social lies in what we&rsquo;re really doing. Not just status updates.</p>
<p>Funny place, Starbucks. I remember when they only use to have coffee and a small array of items. Now they have walls of cups, blends and a full on snack bar. That blueberry coffee cake looks good, but it&rsquo;s a little too expensive for me right now – I haven&rsquo;t even finished my grande mocha.</p>
<p>Along with coffee, Starbucks has gotten increasingly good at another thing: seating people really close to one another. This is remarkable on two levels. 1.) People don&rsquo;t seem to notice that the threshold for what could be considered my “bubble” is dangerously near to being crossed, and 2.) people think you can&rsquo;t hear them talk at low levels from four feet away. Remarkable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I look like such a tool right now. Rocking my Apple Macbook with iPhone set beside me as I drink a grande white-chocolate mocha. Thankfully I have no hair, otherwise I&rsquo;m sure it would complete the look. Out hipstering the hipsters, maybe I have accomplished something tonight.</p>
<p>My coffee has finally reached the point of equilibrium: I can now drink a steady stream and not viciously raze the small village of my tastebuds with scalding lava. Words are fun.</p>
<p>The barista is pulling out the items from the snack bar now, wrapping them in saran and putting them away for tomorrow. I always knew this sort of thing happened, obviously they can&rsquo;t leave the food in there indefinitely, but I&rsquo;ve never actually seen it being done.</p>
<p>My coffee cup is now empty, after I shotgunned the last teaspoon of pure sugary chocolate confection. Decaf probably would have been a better choice for this time at night, but you don&rsquo;t go to Starbucks to get decaf. That would be like going to McDonalds to get a salad – a complete waste of time. If you&rsquo;ve already made it into the building, you are bound by societal law to get that Big Mac with fries, er.. mocha with whipped cream.</p>
<p>This has proven productive. Forcing myself to go somewhere where I&rsquo;d be cornered, literally and metaphorically, into writing has been successful. This was fun.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to change up the setting and remove the “crutches” preventing you from doing what you love. Kick those crutches out from under you, and you just might stand. Try it, I&rsquo;ll take you out for coffee afterwards and we can read the awesome thing you wrote. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter if it sucks, just so long as you did something to give yourself the opportunity to write again. At the end of the night, that&rsquo;s what will make all the difference.</p>

      <h2>Build stuff, tell people</h2>
      <p>Build stuff and tell people. It&rsquo;s a simple mantra. Anyone who makes something (code, designs, gear) should be doing this. You&rsquo;re only going to get better at what you do.</p>
<p>Take the company <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> for example. They&rsquo;re building awesome stuff that lets users share and publish their code, and then writing awesome blog posts about how they did it. Their latest blog post, <a href="https://github.com/blog/1151-designing-github-for-windows">Designing GitHub for Windows</a> talks about the recently released Windows counterpart to their <a href="http://mac.github.com">GitHub for Mac</a> app. Now, Windows users can manage their git repositories without needing to open up a command prompt.</p>
<p>The post takes an in depth look at the steps they took, all the way back from the sketching stage, to put the application together. The app itself is nice, but this sort of blogging-about-the-process is a huge part of what makes GitHub great. Building something awesome and then writing about it is what fosters better programmers, designers and creator culture in general. This isn&rsquo;t the first time they&rsquo;ve done this, just go take a look through <a href="https://github.com/blog">the archives of their blog</a> and you will find posts about the cool stuff they&rsquo;ve built. Everything from major apps to small side projects.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;re making right now. When you&rsquo;re done, write about it. Blogs are free. This is how you get better at what you do. Build stuff, tell people.</p>

      <h2>Flashpoint</h2>
      <p>I loved <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285331/">24</a>. I nearly shed tears during the finale when Chloe had to shut off the drone camera on Jack. It was the first TV series I actually watched each week, as it aired. Now, was it, at times, a little out there? Sure. Did Jack Bauer have a complex that always required people to put their weapons on the ground? Absolutely. Did CTU always choose to ignore the fact that the mole was 95% likely to be one of their own agents? Yea, but what are you gonna do.</p>
<p>But, like I said, 24 came to an end. Thankfully, Netflix gave us seasons eight of the seasons to watch on Instant Streaming. This ate up quite a bit of my time, but after a certain point when you know what&rsquo;s going to happen – near real-time TV episode begins to drag a tad. I became preoccupied with other things, primarily a girl, and 24 slipped out of my routine.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059475/">Flashpoint</a>.</p>
<p>I love this show. The basic premise is that you follow a team of the Police Strategic Response Unit (SRU) in Canada. If you want an American equivalent, a police SWAT team would be a good example.</p>
<p>From the Wikipedia page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SRU are tasked to resolve extreme situations that regular officers are not trained to handle including hostage-taking, bomb threats and heavily armed criminals. Equipped with high-tech tools and a cache of weapons and explosives, members use negotiation tactics and intuition to try to avoid the use of deadly force, only implemented when other options are exhausted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound intense? It is. Thus the name, Flashpoint.</p>
<p>Quick chemistry lesson: a “flash point” for a material is the lowest temperature at which it can form an ignitable mixture with air. Explosive, unpredictable and rapid.</p>
<p>Add a little TV dramatization and you&rsquo;ve got 40+ minutes of solid action and story. But this isn&rsquo;t just a show filled with bomb threats, guns and action – there is some actual psychological thought and effort put into the script. This is best shown during the the show&rsquo;s negotiation scenes.</p>
<p>Negotiation plays a huge part of each episode. Whenever a 911 call gets severe enough to warrant an SRU appearance, the “subject” usually has escalated to a dangerous level and there are usually innocent people around who could be in jeopardy. It then becomes the job of Team Sergeant Gregory Parker to begin negotiations. He begins talking with the subject, trying to talk them down, but always doing so earnestly and with a clear focus on the main goal: getting the hostages / people in danger out safely.</p>
<p>While sometimes other members of his team will handle the negotiations, Parker is clearly the professional. He even wrote the handbook the SRU uses to train new members in negotiation. If you watch enough episodes, you&rsquo;ll eventually hear him echo the sentiment “connect, respect and protect.”</p>
<p>Now, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a realistic show if every negotiation was a success. Sometimes they aren&rsquo;t, and those episodes are emotional. But the reason they manage to maintain a high level of quality in what could be a repetitive theme is the writer&rsquo;s realistic approach to the psychology of someone who&rsquo;s gone a little crazy. It&rsquo;s believable. They don&rsquo;t try and make you stretch too much, and the way the SRU handles every situation make you believe that this actually could be happening somewhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still new in the series, and I do have some criticisms so far. But if you like sharp-written dialogue and a great story, as well as one that actually passes my could-this-really-happen test, you&rsquo;re safe investing in a couple episodes to see if it&rsquo;s your thing. Currently, Netflix has all four seasons available for streaming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving what I&rsquo;ve watched so far, and look forward to another episode tomorrow.</p>

      <h2>Apple, Nintendo and a TV</h2>
      <p>I want to talk about the Apple TV. The one that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/3/">episode 3 of The Talk Show</a> with John Gruber and John Moltz, the duo talked briefly talked about the Apple TV. The WWDC schedule has been released, and there are an unusually large amount of sessions listed as &ldquo;TBA&rdquo; - usually the sign that the content of those sessions will relate to something announced in kickoff keynote. Gruber and Moltz speculate that there wouldn&rsquo;t need to be <em>that</em> many TBAs unless there was some sort of new platform being unveiled. Something that would take up two day&rsquo;s worth of sessions so developers could get their fix and be primed to start writing code. They&rsquo;re guessing that apps are coming to the new Apple TV.</p>
<p>However, while these apps-on-TV rumors have long been in the pipes, something they mentioned which I had not thought of was the use of iDevices as controllers. Something resembling the upcoming Wii U&rsquo;s new touchscreen gamepad.</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/418570/logicalstate/wii-u-gamepad.jpg" alt="wii u gamepad"></p>
<p>This makes sense.</p>
<p>The Mac was never the gaming platform that Windows was. This wasn&rsquo;t because Windows did gaming better, but Windows came on way more hardware configurations than Macintosh. PC gamers can easily upgrade the components in their rig when better hardware comes out, thus playing the latest games, but this sort of upgrade ability has never been Apple&rsquo;s specialty and is often a hassle.</p>
<p>Apple isn&rsquo;t going to attack the high-end, performance heavy gamer community that flock to maxed-out PC rigs and the Xbox / Playstation. They don&rsquo;t need to, and honestly it would probably be a waste of their time. However, there is still a group of gamers Apple already has a great reputation with: the casual players. My mother, sister and most of America could fall under this category. In the race to the living room, however, one console stands in between Apple and the consumer they want: the Wii.</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/418570/logicalstate/ipod-touch-promo.jpg" alt="ipod touch promo"></p>
<p>Why the Wii as a competitor for the new Apple TV? Because Nintendo does casual. The Wii, GameBoy and DS exemplify that. While you&rsquo;re always going to find the latest Call of Duty available on the Wii, this is by far not the best game to showcase the console&rsquo;s strengths. The games that best highlight the Wii&rsquo;s appeal are games like Wii Sports, The Legend of Zelda and other goofy titles. Games that the average gamer can pick up and play with a low learning curve. This is exactly the market that Apple has gone into with the App Store and the iDevices.</p>
<p>Look at Angry Birds, Cut the Rope or Words with Friends and you realize that the millions of people playing these games are dedicating their time to an ecosystem maintained by Apple, and not one in Nintendo&rsquo;s control. While it can be fun to flirt with the idea of one day seeing Mario Kart on my iPhone, I know the odds of that are slim to none. In regards to the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, Apple isn&rsquo;t just selling a mobile device that plays music and browses the Internet, they are selling a game console.</p>
<p>Once you begin to look at gaming as a huge part of Apple&rsquo;s business for iOS, you begin to realize that the one place they still don&rsquo;t have any control in is the living room. According to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the average American in 2010 spent 2.7 hours watching TV per day, and I think Apple wants a piece of that time.</p>
<p>Regardless whether Apple&rsquo;s motive for a TV is to increase content flow through iTunes, or pursuing some sort of casual gaming setup, they want to be there. In your living room. With you as you eat that TV dinner.</p>
<p>Because let&rsquo;s face it. The one thing that we can all agree on is that if Apple does release a full fledged fruit-branded TV, it&rsquo;s not going to be cheap. I&rsquo;m not worried though. With Ramen Noodles hovering around 30c a box, I could make it a couple months.</p>
<p>You know, for a TV that doesn&rsquo;t even exist yet.</p>

      <h2>To the point</h2>
      <p>Tomorrow will be my first experience on a roller coaster.</p>
<p>Now sure, I&rsquo;ve spent the better part of my childhood riding fair “rides,” but none of the holy-cow-we&rsquo;re-upside-down variety.</p>
<p>For my inaugural experience, I will be going to Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. Living not too far from Cedar Point my whole life, I never really recognized what a unique place it is. Opened in 1870, it is the second oldest operating amusement park in the United States. They have a total of 16 roller coasters, most of which I assume we will be experiencing tomorrow, as well as several other attractions for the non-coaster types.</p>
<p>At any rate, now I&rsquo;ll finally be able to use the expression, “like a roller coaster” and not be a total hypocrite for never having been on one.</p>
<p>Special thanks to my girlfriend for setting this all up. Now here&rsquo;s to hoping I don&rsquo;t get flung off and end up in Lake Erie.</p>

      <h2>Great games - Kingdom Rush</h2>
      <p>Upon returning to the apartment this evening, my roommates and I began talking about some of our favorite online games. Back when I was just starting high school and before HTML5 came along, Flash games were me and my friends past time. We spent hours, literally hours, playing some of the classics like <a href="http://dregerkq.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/kingdom-rush/ninjakiwi.com/Games/Bloons-Games/Bloons.html">Bloons</a>, <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/sports-games/miniputt.jsp">Mini Putt</a>, and more. My personal favorite, however, were the tower defense games. From the Wikipedia page for Tower defense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of tower defense games is to try to stop enemies from crossing a map by building towers which shoot at them as they pass. Enemies and towers usually have varied abilities, costs, and ability costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enemies usually travel along a fixed path, and you get to place your towers along the sides. Strategy is of the utmost importance here; you have a limited amount of resources and money to spend on new towers, so you need to make sure that all the paths are covered. Each tower usually has an ability to upgrade its abilities, but all these actions cost extra money. Sometimes it turns out to be a better investment to not upgrade one tower, and instead purchase several less-powerful cheap ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played my fair share of tower defense games. From the cartoon design of <a href="http://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Bloons-Tower-Defense.html">Bloons Tower Defense</a>, to the pixel-geometric <a href="http://criticalthoughtgames.com/geodefense">geoDefense</a>, tower defense games hold a special spot in my heart. However, when my roommates&rsquo; conversation turned to their favorite online games, there was one that stands out in the clear forefront of my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kingdomrush.com/">Kingdom Rush</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Rush is a medieval tower defense game and follows basic strategy as the other; enemies along a path, build towers to defeat them. However, where Kingdom Rush stands alone is in the design and gameplay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exquisitely designed. From the high quality graphics, to the soundtrack and effects, it feels like every pixel was hand crafted by a skilled craftsman. Couple that with the fun animations and “POW!” “WHACK!” that appear above your troops as they battle, and you have a near perfect game.</p>

      <h2>iA Writer 1.2.2</h2>
      <p>Typically, I forget about the Mac App Store. I don&rsquo;t have it in my dock and I haven&rsquo;t had the need to buy an app for my Mac in a while. However, occasionally I&rsquo;ll remember and open it up to check for updates. Boy was there a present waiting for me today.</p>
<p>iA Writer, which is hands-down my favorite writing app on any platform, was updated to version 1.2.2 this week with one very important new feature: copy as HTML. The importance of this feature cannot be understated.</p>
<p>This significance, however, is better understood if you have a little background first.</p>
<p>I love writing for the web. It&rsquo;s such a great medium to share my words on. However, when you start writing for the web, you occasionally have to hard code in certain HTML markup like hyperlinks, pictures or other things. The mess of HTML mixed with plain text made the end document very hard to read for the author. It was just bad.</p>
<p>That all changed when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> created <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a>, a new way to write in plain text, and include HTML elements without having it destroy the simplicity of the document. Taken from Markdown&rsquo;s project page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markdown documents are much more readable than their source-code counterparts, and it was a welcome addition to a web writer&rsquo;s arsenal.</p>
<p>When I started blogging on WordPress, I quickly found out that they had no support for Markdown. In a <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/markdown?replies=4#post-154702">forum post from back in 2008</a>, a staff member cited Markdown as being too CPU intensive for them at the time, but may be available as a paid upgrade in the future.</p>
<p>The now-three-years-later future is here, and still no Markdown support.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t too much of a problem, though. WordPress allows you to author your posts in pure HTML if you like, which many Markdown editors easilly export to. A simple copy-and-paste and you&rsquo;re on your way.</p>
<p>The only problem with my copy-and-paste solution is that iA Writer, where I did all my writing, didn&rsquo;t make this process easy. Before the 1.2.2 update, I had to write my post, export it via the menu to an HTML file, open up that file in a text editor, copy the source, and then paste it into WordPress. It was a hassle, and I even downloaded <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> solely because it offered one-click “copy HTML” feature. For a while, my workflow was iA Writer &gt; Byword &gt; Copy HTML &gt; Paste into WordPress.</p>
<p>No longer.</p>

      <h2>Write it down</h2>
      <p>Last night, my roommates and I watched Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s 2000 film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>. If you think that Inception, or Pulp Fiction was confusing the first time through, Memento can definitely be added to the list of movies that will give you brain whiplash.</p>
<p>Without going into the actual story, Memento follows Lenard, a man who cannot create new memories. He remembers everything in his past, just cannot create new memories. “Everything just fades” he says.</p>
<p>Only being able to remember what has happened within the last couple minutes, Lenard carries around a Polaroid camera and takes pictures of the key people / places he has been. On the back of the photos, he writes down short notes – clues – to help him piece everything back together when his memories fade again.</p>
<p>Watching this all transpire, the slogan of my favorite paper- notebook maker, Field Notes, came into my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing it down to remember it later. I&rsquo;m writing it down to remember it now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lenard was able to survive purely on the fact that he wrote down the things he knew he would forget. It was a matter of life and death for him.</p>
<p>For most of us, however, it&rsquo;s not a matter of life or death, but rather whether we remember to return the Redbox on time, pick up the milk, or make that phone call. None of these things are huge, but each are important in their own way, and it is a hassle whenever we forget to do them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been scribbling notes down for a couple years now, and I&rsquo;m still refining my methods. However, one technique which is incredibly effective, and not necessarily apparent, is to write down everything. You really have to push the boundaries of what you&rsquo;re used to constituting as a “note.” If you started writing down all the little things that clutter up your mind throughout the day (quotes, thoughts for a project, the first lyric of a song), imagine how much less preoccupied your thoughts would be.</p>
<p>Try it. Write down everything that makes you think, “hey, I want to come back to this later.” You will feel less cluttered and able to focus better on the task at hand; all while knowing that the awesome thing you thought of will still be there, and awesome, later.</p>

      <h2>Drawing with paper</h2>
      <p><img src="http://dregerkq.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20120527-000319.jpg?w=640" alt="paper drawing"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this iPad for a couple weeks now, and something that always seems to surprise me is how easy it is for people to just pick up and start using.</p>
<p>This is particularly highlighted by my recent attempts to put Xubuntu on my grandfather&rsquo;s aging iBook. Device drivers be darned.</p>
<p>When people pick up the iPad, there is some level of intuitiveness that they just get. Most recently, I was letting my girlfriend explore around and she opened up Paper by 53. Paper is an amazing sketching/painting/drawing app with an even more amazing interface. After showing her how to pull up the different brushes, I didn&rsquo;t give her any more guidance and she created the picture you see above.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t taken the iPad away, she would still probably be drawing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said for this type of interaction, and that&rsquo;s why Apple is world known. They&rsquo;ve created something magical that lets the user dive into the app and create, not just consume. As much as I enjoy using the iPad myself, there is something even more cool about watching others use it. Especially if it is their first time in a particular app.</p>

      <h2>Smart people ask questions</h2>
      <p>Today marks the end of Orientation Day at <a href="http://timken.com">The Timken Company</a>. Hats off to the University relations team for putting together a great program for us; I&rsquo;ve been to much shorter programs which felt twice as long. Informative, fun and a great way to get our feet wet the first day.</p>
<p>I took plenty of things away from today, including one of the amazing spare lunches (boxed <a href="http://www.honeybakedham.com/catering.asp">Honey Baked Ham sandwiches</a>), but what I&rsquo;m most impressed with is how well they treat their interns. It&rsquo;s a foundation of respect that you feel, even though you&rsquo;re the lowest ones on the totem pole.</p>
<p>I turned out to be quite a successful at all the activities we had participated in today, netting three different gift cards as prizes, but something I wasn&rsquo;t expecting was a live presentation from the CEO and current President: <a href="http://www.timken.com/en-us/about/leadership/Pages/JamesWGriffith.aspx">James W. Griffith</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many CEO&rsquo;s of companies as large as Timken make time to come to an intern orientation day, but there can&rsquo;t be many. Seeing President Griffith and being able to spend 45 some minutes listening to him speak and then having our own personal Q&amp;A session was awesome. As much as I respected his position before this morning, I respect him that much more for making time for us.</p>
<h2 id="smart-people-ask-questions">Smart people ask questions</h2>
<p>Something that the session with President Griffith reminded me of was an article by Tommy MacWilliam called <a href="http://blog.tommymacwilliam.com/post/17500383225/what-ive-learned-about-smart-people">What I&rsquo;ve Learned About Smart People</a>. MacWilliam is a student at Harvard and has had the chance to be around <em>a lot</em> of incredibly intelligent individuals. From this, and the fact he seems to be a pretty bright guy himself, he&rsquo;s noticed that <strong>smart people ask questions</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smart people are different. If they don&rsquo;t understand something, or even if they think they understand something, they&rsquo;ll ask questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>It was this idea that persuaded me to raise my hand and ask President Griffith a question. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what I asked, it was something about how heavily Timken takes a business&rsquo;s patents into account when looking to acquire that company, but I knew I had to ask something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I wasn&rsquo;t really nervous and scribbled down a draft of my question to get the wording right, but after asking, not only did I feel proud - I also got a great response and direct conversation with the CEO.</p>
<p>Asking questions, especially when you are surrounded by people way smarter than yourself is always going to be intimidating. You don&rsquo;t want to sound stupid, or ask something that isn&rsquo;t relevant, but regardless how nervous you feel, just ask. Make it a good question and ask. It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h2 id="alarm-set-for-710-am">Alarm set for 7:10 AM</h2>
<p>Tomorrow will mark my first <em>actual</em> day of work for The Timken Company. It seems like a decade has passed since I first submitted my application and resumé. I&rsquo;m ready to dive in. Here we go.</p>

      <h2>Lens</h2>
      <p>I just made my first camera lens in Adobe Illustrator. Following the awesome <a href="http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustration/create-an-aperture-style-camera-lens-icon/">tutorial on Tuts+</a>, it took me about two hours to complete. I&rsquo;ve got lots of improving to do, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn how to make something this intricate and downright cool.</p>
<p>Illustration is a world I&rsquo;ve long looked at, but never really set foot in like I did with web design. However, after only two hours working on the camera lens, I realized that I have a strong passion for this type of design. Being able to create <em>anything</em> I can think of makes me feel enlivened.</p>
<p>With enough effort, anyone can learn practically anything with the Internet. Hopefully by the end of this summer, I will be a much better illustrator than I am now, and have learned a new way to create things I enjoy.</p>

      <h2>Twenty</h2>
      <p>Today, I turn twenty. It&rsquo;s almost unbelievable that our bodies, for how fragile they are, can even <em>hold up</em> for that long. Nevertheless, two decades in these shoes and I thank Him for every minute in them. There are other people that deserve some thanks as well and today feels like great opportunity do so.</p>
<p><strong>To those older than me</strong>: Thank you for knowingly, or unknowingly, helping to guide me as I&rsquo;ve grown. As the oldest of my siblings, I&rsquo;m accustomed to being the first one to try something new. Though I would be nervous going down an untraveled road, I took peace in knowing that I had people around me who had done it before. Thank you for never giving me an excuse to quit.</p>
<p>Also, thank you for all the work you&rsquo;ve done, and will do in your lives. All my accomplishments have been built upon the work someone else has done. As Isaac Newton said, &ldquo;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>To those younger than me</strong>: Thank you for your spirit and reminding me that life is all perspective. I&rsquo;m at an age where I acknowledge how short life really is - it boggles my mind that in just ten years I will be thirty with a completely different life than now. However, no matter how old I get, whenever I see you all working hard and enjoying life, it motivates me to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>To those I call my peers</strong>: Thank you for being there to experience and share in the adventure. Having people in your life who are experiencing the same things at the same time as you is awesome. It is this shared experience that is the glue of our generation. As a new generation grows up, let us not forget the days of video cassettes, dial-up Internet, or phones with antennas. These memories are dear to me, as I&rsquo;m sure they are to you.</p>
<p><strong>To my family and girlfriend</strong>: Dear family: I love you guys. Brother, sisters, parents, cousins, grandparents, aunts, uncles, my dogs - unfaltering in support and providing nothing but love towards me even in failure. You guys are the most unique, crazy group of people I&rsquo;ve ever met and I&rsquo;m proud to call you all my own.</p>
<p>Dear girlfriend: I could not have asked Him for a more wonderful individual to share my life with. Seriously, you&rsquo;re my best friend and you make me very, very happy.</p>
<p><strong>To my God</strong>: Thank you for blessing me with the life I have and the people in it. Although I sometimes feel guilty for being so blessed when some have so little, let me only work harder to use my gifts in ways that will help others. Thank you for each day I get to wake up and experience your grace. Help me to be an even better echo of your message these next twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>To you</strong>: Thank you for reading. It may be my birthday, but I hope you have, or make, an awesome day for you too.</p>

      <h2>5 things I&#39;ve learned in 19 years</h2>
      <p>This past April, I turned 19. Almost two decades worth of time have been given to me and I wanted to take a little time to reflect on five core things I&rsquo;ve learned these past 228 months. I write this for my siblings; that they can use it as a roadmap around the pits I fell in.</p>
<p><strong>One</strong>: Don&rsquo;t be cool — I&rsquo;ve spent so much of my life trying to be cool. Unfortunately, it is such an ambiguous term and dictated by people who are just as lost as you feel. Cool should be a term you use everyday. It&rsquo;s cool you like your hobbies. It&rsquo;s cool you feel comfortable in any brand. It&rsquo;s cool you love God. Cool should be a way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong>: Forgive — Always forgive. Always. There is no reason to hang on to any shred of anger, resentment, or sadness. Forgive yourself. We only have a limited amount of time to live and I regret all the time I spent locking emotions inside and not forgiving those who had hurt me. The second you forgive, and I mean truly forgive,  is the moment you will be set free.</p>
<p><strong>Three</strong>: Less — Own less. Buy less. Give away more. It&rsquo;s hard in a materialistic world and society to not want. But these things really create a hidden burden on you. The number of times I&rsquo;ve gone through my clothes and half of them are things I haven&rsquo;t worn in years are too many to count. Give things away. Don&rsquo;t hoard meaningless items. You will be surprised by just how little you can live on and still be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Four</strong>: Own your education — Education is an opportunity, not a right. I&rsquo;ve never been overseas, but by nature of growing up and going to college I know how valuable education is and how desperately people in other countries wish they had it. Mom and Dad can push you all they want, but at the end of the day it will be just you and your flashcards studying for that Friday test. Even though we all don&rsquo;t learn the same, there&rsquo;s no reason we shouldn&rsquo;t all be putting in the same amount of effort. Give everything you have to your schoolwork. Dedicate yourself to studying before you go to bed. When you do things like this, you are setting yourself up to accomplish whatever God has planned for you.</p>
<p><strong>Five</strong>: Get up — You&rsquo;re going to fall. You&rsquo;re going to fail. You&rsquo;re going to be at rock bottom. And you&rsquo;re going to be okay. Falling sucks. You let people down and you let yourself down. But never let your current situation define you. You may have fallen, but true character is shown in the way you get back up. Learn from failures, and learn that failures are really opportunities to become a better individual. Some of the biggest falls in my life have turned around to be the moments where I truly defined my character and who I want to be. This takes time and you will feel terrible, but falling is our chance to prove we can rise again.</p>
<p>There are many other things I&rsquo;ve learned, but those are the big ones. Life has so much to teach you, but you need to keep your eyes open in order to see the moments to take advantage of them. Remember to have fun and keep God at the center of your focus and life. Live, laugh and always love.</p>

      <h2>When bloggers die</h2>
      <p>The question <em>&ldquo;what happens when bloggers die?&quot;</em>  has been bugging me a lot lately. It seems that in a day in age where content creation is so immediate, so instantaneous, the last thing anyone seems to be thinking about is when all that creation eventually stops. Now, this isn&rsquo;t suppose to be cynical, or depressing, simply inquisitive. What is going to happen if, when, bloggers start to die, taking their archives of content with them?</p>
<p>My mind jumps to John Gruber as an example. We&rsquo;ve never met in person, although I live just a state away, but I feel that we have a relationship. Since I first started reading news online, I&rsquo;ve been reading John&rsquo;s Apple-oriented blog, Daring Fireball. Although he has his critics, and haters gonna hate, he has been a huge inspiration for me to always be a critical thinker and reader when it comes to news and texts.</p>
<p>With this mindset, whenever I saw Mr. Gruber link back to an article he previously wrote, whether to confirm some past prediction or simply to prevent writing a similar post, I would click along and reread the article. I enjoyed the sense of flying back in time, a childhood dream, and the journey never got old. It was during such a scenario that I first noticed the &ldquo;Archive&rdquo; link on the left navigation list. Almost every news / blog website in the world has a link like this, yet I had never explored any of them. Maybe it was my infatuation with current news, I&rsquo;ve spent way too much time refreshing my RSS news feed, that stopped me, or I never deemed it worth my time. Regardless, I clicked through and, as all pretend time-machine pilots do, went back to the oldest article I could find.</p>
<p>I came to a stop on the 13th of August, 2002. It was a Tuesday. The article itself was interesting enough, Gruber was writing about the new Power Mac G4&rsquo;s Apple had just introduced, and it was intriguing to read an article related to Apple that didn&rsquo;t include the word &ldquo;app&rdquo; anywhere [1]. It was here that my mind starting clicking. In front of me was something valuable, as with all history, and there was something to be gained by reading this eight year old article if only for the perception. However, unlike larger sites with an actual staff like Engadget, TechCrunch, or Wired, Daring Fireball was a one man show. A great one man show, but run by one man nonetheless.</p>
<p>Being in a state of aging myself, 18 feels like the new 30, I thought about the future of Daring Fireball. What would happen when its author was no longer writing? Moving to my life, for example, if I ever were to pass away, I am unsure if my family even knows about my blog. Sure, I&rsquo;ve shown them articles, but what happens when the things I take care of, domain / hosting / etc., start to expire. The situation amplifies itself when you consider the huge number of websites that are now hosted by 3rd parties like Tumblr, Posterous, and Wordpress. Quick enough, and with little help I&rsquo;m sure, my online identity would fade away as if it never existed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Gruber has set up, as things like this are personal affairs, but I would hate to see a resource like the archive of Daring Fireball fade away leaving only dead links and poorly cached Google copies. While this is probably far from what will happen to DF (if I&rsquo;ve though about it, odds are Gruber has), it raises a larger question: what happens when bloggers start dying? Or to be more specific, what should happen to their content once they pass away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone has really thought about this in depth and really, how can you blame them. When Tim Berners-Lee, the man who created the very medium of the work, the Internet, is still alive and well, where does that leave time to think about death? Will legal wills of the future contain paragraphs explaining who is to receive the domain addresses, Twitter usernames, or similar? It seems silly now, indeed I fear I lose credibility with some assumptions, but in an ever growing world, both on- and offline, things like domains and the reputations they carry will only become more valuable. Coming back to my example of Daring Fireball, if we never start thinking about ways to keep single-person run websites available as resources to the future generations, I fear we may cost them unique insight to a time when things were less connected [2].</p>
<p>I realize that there are many, many, other great single-person websites out there, and I read plenty of them. However, for examples sake I chose to run with Daring Fireball and John Gruber since I&rsquo;ve been reading his work the longest. Some will ask why would an 18 year old college freshman start thinking about the eventual passing of someone he had a, probably one-way, Internet relationship with, and in all honesty I have no idea. I wish Mr. Gruber nothing but a long and wonderful life with his family and a successful career. However, I feel that this is a topic that deserves some thought. Not only to ensure archives of valuable content online for the future, but also how to handle the transferring of online properties such as web domains.</p>
<p>We may still be quite a few years out from ever having to worry about something like this, and there is always the possibility that losing these resources is an empty fear of mine. Undoubtedly, with the cost of huge storage devices going down every day, to save a complete, design included, archive of many of the websites I had in mind could be done for relatively cheap [3].</p>
<p>However, just in case we do have something to be worried about, I would rather add a little fire to the flames of this conversation now instead of waiting around.</p>
<p>I wish you all long and happy lives, bloggers of the Internet. Keep up the good work. In the spirit of ending things on a high note, I close with an <a href="http://tincorporated.com/writing/2009/sep/28/get-busy-living-or-get-busy-dying/">excerpt from a post</a> by Tom Watson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop, or at the very least reduce, the re-blogging, re-tweeting, re-sharing, regurgitation and make something. Produce content. Create a great design, dust off that camera and start taking photos or close that browser and start writing. Because trust me, there are plenty of people out there sharing. Do something different&hellip;</p>
<p>Make something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2 - While discussing this topic with some peers, we thought about print as an option for archiving. However, the initial problem is obviously the size and cost needed to archive every single article out there. And secondly, these types of text were designed for the medium of the web and should stay there.</p>
<p>3 - Design has become an integral part of how we view text on the web. The integrity of each website design needs to be kept in order for the text to be interpreted as the author intended.</p>

      <h2>&#34;So is San Francisco really the perfect system font for Apple’s products? It’s complicated.&#34;</h2>
      <p>MartianCraft&rsquo;s Nick Keppol wrote two <em>incredibly</em> detailed posts on the typographic strengths and weaknesses of Apple&rsquo;s new sans-serif typeface. <a href="http://martiancraft.com/blog/2015/10/why-san-francisco/">Part one</a> looks at San Francisco in contrast with Lucida Grande, Helvetica Neue, and DIN. <a href="http://martiancraft.com/blog/2015/10/san-francisco-part-2/">Part two</a> focuses on San Francisco&rsquo;s various weights, with particular interest paid to the nuances between San Francisco UI, Text, and Compact.</p>
<p>I have a non-Retina Macbook Pro, and the general legibility of OS X was dramatically increased after I upgraded to El Capitan. San Francisco is so good that apps still using Lucida Grande or Helvetica Neue stick out like a sore thumb.</p>

      <h2>&#39;Design is about solving problems that humans have, not problems that products have&#39;</h2>
      <p>Mills Baker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if our best designers, ensconced in their labs with world-class teams, cannot reliably produce successful products, we should admit to ourselves that perhaps so-called “design science” remains much less developed than computer science, and that we’d do well to stay humble despite our rising stature. Design’s new prominence means that design’s failures have ever-greater visibility. Having the integrity and introspective accuracy to distinguish what one likes from what is good, useful, meaningful is vital; we do not work for ourselves but for our users. What do they want? What do they need? From what will they benefit? While answering these questions, we should hew to data, be intuitive about our users and their needs, and subject our designs to significant criticism and use before validating them.</p>

<p>If you do any sort of design work, read this. Then bookmark it. Then read it again, once every month.</p>

      <h2>&#39;Dumb&#39;</h2>
      <p>Shawn Blanc, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/dumb/">on the recent news regarding smartwatches</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So often I&rsquo;d be standing in line at the grocery store and I&rsquo;d pull out my iPhone to see what time it was. Then, out of sheer habit, I&rsquo;d swipe to unlock and the next thing you know I&rsquo;m mindlessly scrolling through tweets or reading emails without actually acting on them. Then the line would move, I&rsquo;d put the iPhone back in my pocket, and if you&rsquo;d asked me what time it was I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My analog watches are my reminder that utility exists apart from an internet connection and usefulness doesn&rsquo;t require the latest software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usefulness doesn&rsquo;t require any software at all, and not all perceived &ldquo;problems&rdquo; are ones that need addressed by another electronic device.</p>

      <h2>&#39;For Immediate Release&#39;</h2>
      <p>Yesterday, Hoefler &amp; Co. <a href="http://typography.com/press/20140117">issued a public statement</a> in regards to Tobias Frere-Jones suing Jonathan Hoefler. The company&rsquo;s General Counsel, Michael Burke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week, designer Tobias Frere-Jones, a longtime employee of The Hoefler Type Foundry, Inc. (d/b/a &ldquo;Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones&rdquo;), decided to leave the company. With Tobias&rsquo;s departure, the company founded by Jonathan Hoefler in 1989 will become known as Hoefler &amp; Co. &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It goes without saying that all of us are disappointed by Tobias&rsquo;s actions. The company will vigorously defend itself against these allegations, which are false and without legal merit. In the meantime, we&rsquo;re all hard at work, continuing to create the kinds of typefaces that designers have come to expect from us for more than 25 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frere-Jones sues for $20 million dollars. Hoefler changes the company name. Until both parties go to trial, it is going to be near impossible to understand what really went on here.</p>

      <p>Adam Pash:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently switched from an iPhone to Android, and discovered shortly thereafter that my phone number was still associated with iMessage, meaning that any time someone with an iPhone tried texting me, I’d receive nothing, and they’d get a “Delivered” receipt in their Messages app as though everything were working as expected.</p>

      <h2>&#39;Special&#39;</h2>
      <p>Out of all the nostalgic posts regarding the Macintosh&rsquo;s 30th birthday, I like John Gruber&rsquo;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/01/special">anecdotal piece the best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For one thing, they [the original Macintosh team] sweated the details. The greatest testimony to their genius is just how much of that original design is recognizable in today’s Mac OS X 10.9. A Mac user from 1984 could sit down in front of an iMac or MacBook today and recognize it as a successor to that original machine. That’s simply amazing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really enjoy when Gruber opines on the business of Apple, but I think his articles about the <em>products</em> of Apple are particularly insightful and special.</p>

      <h2>100 words on design</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m stealing this &ldquo;100 words&rdquo; exercise <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/8577">from Jeremy Keith</a>. It&rsquo;s a fantastic idea, and as Mr. Keith says, &ldquo;when it comes to writing, there are no shortcuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also believe that writing can be a great way to learn. Take any topic, write 10,000 words about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll finish smarter than you started.</p>
<p>For this experiment, I want to spend some time exploring what it takes to design great digital products. Specifically, I want to get better at recognizing what makes good designs good and others not.</p>
<h2 id="001">001</h2>
<p>Bias is the preference of one thing over another. It&rsquo;s the reason some people use iOS and others Android. It&rsquo;s why I favor buying certain types of shoes, and it even influences what I order when we&rsquo;re out for ice cream.</p>
<p>Recognizing your own biases is incredibly important.  Product designers rarely, if ever, design websites or applications for a single user; rather, we&rsquo;re creating something for a wide range of people, each with different personalities, behaviors, and preferences. There&rsquo;s no room for unfounded or blind bias in good products.</p>
<p>I really like the way <a href="https://twitter.com/_bklmn">Joel Beukelman</a> puts it: &ldquo;get bias from experience, not ignorance.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t like big phones, but have never used a big phone, that&rsquo;s ignorant bias. If you don&rsquo;t like big phones because you&rsquo;ve actually <em>used</em> one for a period of time and don&rsquo;t like  how it&rsquo;s difficult to reach the screen corners, that&rsquo;s bias from experience.</p>
<p>Everyone has bias, but it seems the best designers regularly challenge their own assumptions, and they&rsquo;re acutely aware of how their personal preferences may influence a product&rsquo;s design.</p>
<h2 id="002">002</h2>
<p>Users like to know that they&rsquo;re using a product correctly. Knowing this, designers will often use small visual cues to help reaffirm the intended use of their product.</p>
<p>But what about for apps that can be used in many different ways? Periscope is such an example. Periscope lets a user broadcast realtime video from their phone, but once things get streaming, it&rsquo;s hard to know how the user is feeling. Are they feeling self-conscious or confused (like I was, after seeing my face onscreen)? And you don&rsquo;t want the system to pop up a &ldquo;looking good!&rdquo; message if, in fact, they&rsquo;re bombing it.</p>
<p>Periscope handles this by providing the audience with a frictionless method of sending positive, visual feedback during a stream. All the audience has to do is tap on their screen and little, colored hearts will appear. There&rsquo;s no limit to the number of hearts a single viewer can create, so a single person could produce a plethora of visual, realtime feedback for the broadcaster.</p>
<p>Periscope encourages the audience to encourage the broadcaster, which ends up coming across far more genuine than any canned message ever could. It&rsquo;s cute, and it works.</p>

      <h2>9 Million iPhones Sold, 200 Million Users on iOS 7</h2>
      <p>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/23First-Weekend-iPhone-Sales-Top-Nine-Million-Sets-New-Record.html">just announced</a> that they sold over nine million new iPhones this past weekend, breaking all previous records for a product launch. They also noted that over 200 million users have upgraded to iOS 7.</p>
<h3 id="iphone-sales">iPhone Sales</h3>
<p>Make no mistake, nine million is a huge number for Apple on a product launch weekend. However, since we weren&rsquo;t given the breakdown of sales between the 5C and 5S, I&rsquo;m going to take this one with a grain of salt — especially since <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html">Apple sold over five million</a> iPhone 5s on launch weekend last year.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, Apple sold 4.5 million of each new iPhone, breaking no single-device record, but still selling a boatload of phones.</p>
<h3 id="ios-7-adoption-rate">iOS 7 Adoption Rate</h3>
<p>At their September 10th event this year, Apple announced they would be <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715256/apple-700-million-ios-devices-sold-by-end-of-september">shipping their 700 millionth</a> iOS device by the end of September. Today, with over 200 million users now running iOS 7, this means that Apple has nearly 28% adoption for a three-day-old operating system. That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>SIDE NOTE: Living on a university campus, even one with decently fast internet, the iOS 7 launch absolutely crippled our network. Browsing tweets and Facebook posts from friends at other schools confirmed this was not an isolated issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a huge three days for Apple. And, keeping my ear open to the conversations on campus, it seems iOS 7 is gaining both appreciation and support the more people use it.</p>

      <h2>A $19 Billion Partnership</h2>
      <p>Interesting choice of words from WhatsApp founder Jan Koum <a href="http://blog.whatsapp.com/index.php/2014/03/setting-the-record-straight/">on the company&rsquo;s blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn&rsquo;t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to believe this is true, but given the price tag, I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; is right. You were acquired. Even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101272463589561">Zuckerberg says so</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>iOS 7&rsquo;s designers have abandoned bordered buttons in favor of borderless colored text. I think this choice is unjustifiable. It is the root cause of my deep dislike for how it feels to use iOS 7. It introduces unnecessary tension and makes everything less usable than it ought to be.</p>

      <h2>A Change to Linked Items</h2>
      <p>Over the past two months, I&rsquo;ve been linking to various articles, apps, and items that I&rsquo;ve thought my readers would enjoy. However I&rsquo;ve noticed that the amount of commentary I&rsquo;ve been adding to each linked item has been dropping — this is not something I want.</p>
<p>To counter this trend, the linked items will be taking a different form over the coming weeks. Firstly, I&rsquo;ll be renaming the linked items to &ldquo;excerpts&rdquo; — something I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/links/2013/11/14/rands-in-rss/">unashamedly borrowed</a> from Michael Lopp of <em>Rands in Repose</em>. Secondly, I&rsquo;m going to try and make each excerpt follow along these guidelines (also borrowed from Lopp):</p>
<ul>
<li>Be short.</li>
<li>Add original commentary – don&rsquo;t be simple links or quotes to other articles.</li>
<li>Appear more frequent than the long form posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this adds a new level of writing to my current load, I think it will be manageable by dropping my post-per-day goal down to just a single entry a day.</p>
<p>Hopefully this change keeps fresh stories on the site and allows me to keep the quality of each item high. It will be interesting to see how this experiment goes given the impending exam week, but I feel confident that this will be a long-term change for the best.</p>

      <h2>A less Pro Macbook</h2>
      <p><em>(Update: I ended up sticking with my Macbook Pro. I love it too much.)</em></p>
<p>I recently got myself a 13&rsquo; Macbook Pro. This thing flies. It is absolutely great for anything that needs a little extra horsepower and it performs really well with anything I throw at it. However, it feels like overkill. More importantly, it is making me feel like I&rsquo;m losing touch with what I really <em>need</em>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want power. The sad truth is that no amount of CPU or RAM is going to make me sit down and actually start writing. What I want is something simpler, less fancy. Where I&rsquo;m the one supplying the power.</p>
<p>My thoughts turned to the Macbook Air as a possible replacement. It&rsquo;s less powerful, much more light and would easilly go with me wherever I wanted to go. I hate staying in my dorm when I work, but the thought of adding seven extra pounds to my backpack just to bring my laptop along makes me cringe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read plenty of posts online saying that the MBA is capable of doing development work, one of the only things I was worried about. I&rsquo;m going to continue looking around and maybe try to find a buyer for my practically brand new Macbook Pro. I appreciate the power, but I just don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

      <p>Sabrina Imbler, writing for Audubon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To create Piper, Barillaro and his entire team entered the Sanderlings’ world. They spent weekends on beaches all over the Bay Area, meeting at 5 a.m. on a dusty road under a bridge in search of the birds. “Half of us were chasing around different beaches and calling each other on cell phones until we found a flock we could get close to,” Barillaro says. “It became this treasure hunt.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever I read about Pixar&rsquo;s process, I smile, because they go all in on the small things. We&rsquo;re going to see &ldquo;Finding Dory&rdquo; tonight, but I&rsquo;m almost always more excited to see Pixar&rsquo;s newest short films.</p>

      <h2>A Note on Touch</h2>
      <p>Touch is a fundamental part of how humans build relationships. We hug, we shake hands, we high-five. Touch is one of the most intimate ways to build a relationship that we know. When Apple made interaction with your device exclusive to the touch of fingers, and nailed the user experience, the depth and strength of the relationships we built with those devices was fundamentally changed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is because our hands are such an intimate form of communication that I&rsquo;m wary of strapping a smartwatch to my wrist. I like my iPhone, but I also like that my interaction with it is on my terms. If I don&rsquo;t want to be interrupted, I just leave it in my pocket. Not so with smartwatches. By putting one on, you graduate your smartphone&rsquo;s visibility to a level that puts it mere inches from your hands and fingers at all times. There&rsquo;s no escaping.</p>
<p>Much like the head and eyes, the hands and wrist are a sacred place. Any device that wants to reside there should be held to a higher standard of design, function, usability, and software.</p>

      <h2>A Small Exchange with Solebon LLC</h2>
      <p>A couple of months ago, I noticed that iOS word game Letterpress appeared to have [changed owners from Loren Brichter&rsquo;s Atebits to Solebon LLC][me]. After some time had passed, I reached out to Solebon to get a little more information about the acquisition. We had a short exchange of emails, and that conversation is below.</p>
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Solebon LLC</strong>: Solebon acquired Letterpress from Atebits in December 2015. We had approached Loren Brichter in 2Q of 2015 but he wasn&rsquo;t interested in selling at that time. We revisited the topic with him in 4Q and agreed to move forward.</p>
<p>Solebon has acquired all the assets and intellectual property related to Letterpress with the exception of any open source code as noted within the credits in the app (standard stuff). Loren remains involved as an advisor providing feedback on our development roadmap and related design and technical issues as requested.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t speak to what Loren is up to these days as we don&rsquo;t know. We can tell you from experience that Loren is very sharp and creative as you would expect from his reputation but he is also just a very thoughtful and all around good guy. No doubt he has plenty of opportunities on his plate.</p>
<p>Going forward, we just released the 2.0 version of Letterpress which utilizes a new game server. Not only does this lay the groundwork for new features (like chat) but it enables expansion to other operating systems down the road. This update has been a bit bumpy due to a small bug impacting a few players and [last week&rsquo;s][icloud] big outage with many Apple services. Things are smoothing out.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger</strong>: Considering your portfolio, which consists exclusively of card games, what drew you to a word game like Letterpress as a potential property to acquire? </p>
<p><strong>Solebon</strong>: Great question. Our interests are more broadly aligned with what we consider as &ldquo;unique casual evergreen&rdquo; titles that we believe everyone should have on their devices. Solebon was the very first solitaire app on iOS. It was recruited by Apple to launch with the app store. Currently, it&rsquo;s not the biggest player in the card game space but we believe it is the best and that it will grow with continued investment.</p>
<p>Letterpress has a unique story as well among word games and we are both honored and excited to make the investments required for it to grow. We own some other interesting apps that are in varying stages of investment including sudoku, chess and puzzle titles. Admittedly, we have our hands full right now particularly with iOS 10 and new devices coming in the next few months.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger</strong>: Great, thank you for your time!</p>

      <h2>A Usability Audit on Myself</h2>
      <p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like tearing apart your own work,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and that&rsquo;s exactly what I did after looking at the usability of kyledreger.com.</p>
<p>Most of the changes I made came from the feedback I&rsquo;ve gotten from readers and from my own observation of people using the site. Although this design is quite different from the previous version, I feel that I&rsquo;ve addressed a number of usability issues that make the site more enjoyable to visit.</p>
<h3 id="layout-and-typography-size">Layout and Typography Size</h3>
<p>One of the problems with the two-column layout I implemented was that it forced me to use a smaller font size for my content in order to keep the overall page width down. However, after watching some of my readers squint while navigating the site, my own fiancee needing her glasses at times, I decided that legibility superseded the need for two columns.</p>
<p>Originally, the base font size was set to 13px. Now the smallest font size you&rsquo;ll see here is 16px. Although just a 3px difference, I now have little doubt that most readers can comfortably read my content. I also adjusted the font weight and size of several other elements, and the current typography styles are as follows (Note: &ldquo;em&rdquo; is the size relative to the base copy):</p>
<ul>
<li>Body copy: 16px</li>
<li>Article headings: 2.5em, bold</li>
<li>Page titles: 2.5em, normal weight (the lack of bolding allows for visual recognition that you are currently on a <em>page</em> not an <em>article</em>.</li>
<li>Headers within an article: 1.25em, bold, uppercase, 1px letter spacing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="renaming-for-clarity">Renaming for Clarity</h3>
<p>My original navigation was named like this (navigation text: &ldquo;page title&rdquo;):</p>
<ul>
<li>Archive: &ldquo;The Archives&rdquo;</li>
<li>Colophon: &ldquo;Colophon&rdquo;</li>
<li>Contact: &ldquo;Contact&rdquo;</li>
<li>RSS Feed: &ldquo;Syndicate Feeds&rdquo;</li>
<li>Twitter Feed: &ldquo;n/a.&rdquo; — link to @kyledregercom</li>
</ul>
<p>This posed several problems. Most of my readers didn&rsquo;t know that &ldquo;colophon&rdquo; is a publishing term for &ldquo;about this publication.&rdquo; In addition, I had the link to my Twitter account on both the RSS Feed page and the navigation — did I really need both? Finally, the title of &ldquo;RSS Feed&rdquo; was misleading: clicking it wouldn&rsquo;t take you to the actual feed, rather it presented you with ways to subscribe to the site.</p>
<p>Since clarity was one of my goals for the site, I made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the navigation text for &ldquo;Colophon&rdquo; to &ldquo;About&rdquo; and make it the first link in the list. Also change the page title to &ldquo;About This Site&rdquo; (clear purpose).</li>
<li>Remove the navigation link pointing to Twitter.</li>
<li>Rename &ldquo;RSS Feed&rdquo; to &ldquo;Subscribe&rdquo; and change the page title from &ldquo;Syndicate Feeds&rdquo; (too fancy) to &ldquo;Ways to Subscribe&rdquo; (simple, actionable).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-kyledregercom">What is kyledreger.com?</h3>
<p>For a while, I tried to get away with the tagline &ldquo;Written before a live audience&rdquo; underneath my site title. Although this sounded clever, it was also a lie. I wasn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> inviting a bunch of people into my dorm room to watch me write, so the saying was, at best, a nostalgic nod to an old quote used by television studios.</p>
<p>However, I still needed some way to let readers know what type of content they could expect and who was writing it. To my embarrassment, nowhere on the site did I say what topics I would be writing about. This left my new readers to infer this on their own, based on my latest few posts.</p>
<p>Still forgoing a tagline, I wrote a brand new introduction to this site and myself on the About page. I styled the text in the form of a dictionary definition, but that was just for fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>kyledreger.com</strong> <em>n.</em> A small webcolumn featuring long-form articles and short commentary on the world of technology, design, and liberal arts. Readers of this site tend to have an interest in new technologies, typography, web design, Apple Inc., and cool apps. All content is written and produced by Kyle Dreger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result is a clear message as to what I write about and who I try to write for. It does a 100x better managing reader expectations than the previous tagline, and it positions kyledreger.com as a simple and honest publication.</p>
<p>I found that performing a usability audit on my own site to be very rewarding, and I feel that it leaves kyledreger.com in a better place than when I began. This is a good first step, but I&rsquo;m always open to hearing your feedback on the changes. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> with any questions or comments, and, as always, thanks for reading.</p>

      <h2>A Year of Nothing New</h2>
      <p>It seems I wasn’t the only one who wanted to mentally, physically, and spiritually start cleaning out the clutter that seems to accrue with time. Sarah Durr, my good friend and future sister-in-law, writing over on her blog <em>Life, Love and Words</em>, says she’s giving up buying anything new for a whole year. This part is my favorite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I started asking myself: What is the reason we own anything other than what we need? The answer isn’t even really because &ldquo;we want&rdquo; but rather simply because we can. Because we have the resources to have not just a home, but one filled with things. And we live in a society where the ability to have things becomes a right, and we forget anything we claim ownership of isn’t actually ours.. Nothing ever is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has been incredibly good to me and to my family. I have never had to experience a day without food, or a night without a place to sleep. As I type this from my personal Macbook, sitting beside the latest iPhone, I am reminded how easily our &ldquo;things&rdquo; can become distractions, separating us from people, nature, and time.</p>
<p>One of Sarah&rsquo;s main examples of spending was the act of buying new clothing; mine would be purchasing new apps. I&rsquo;ve [written about this issue]({% post_url 2011-09-28-appaholic %}) before, and I always struggle with finding a healthy cutoff point — one that lets me still review cool apps but without impulsively buying anything unnecessary. I&rsquo;ll be revisiting my habits in that regard this week.</p>
<p>Regardless, the very fact I am writing these words right now means that I have been given the gift of today. I don&rsquo;t yet have tomorrow, and I should do everything possible to make the world a little better with the time I have right now. That&rsquo;s all any of us have.</p>

      <h2>ABC&#39;s One-On-One with Tim Cook</h2>
      <p>ABC News has put up <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/apple-ceo-speaks-21660730">a video of their one-on-one interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>. David Muir, ABC&rsquo;s interviewer, and Cook discussed the new Mac Pro, Apple&rsquo;s increasing focus on manufacturing within the U.S., and the government&rsquo;s transparency. Craig Federighi and Bud Tribble made guest appearances in the video, but they were not taped while speaking.</p>
<p>In regards to the government, Cook was adamant that no “backdoor” exists on Apple&rsquo;s servers. He also said that Apple will be pushing congress to be more transparent with data requests for users&rsquo; information.</p>
<p>The video ended with Muir and Cook talking about Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Muir: Steve Jobs said to you, &ldquo;I never want you to ask what I would have done, just do whats right.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cook: &ldquo;By saying what he said, for me, it relieved I believe a huge burden that would have existed had he not said it. And so I think it was incredible for him to do that.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you ever needed a final nail in the coffin of the &ldquo;what would Jobs have done&rdquo; argument, this is it. Jobs wanted Cook to run Apple the way Cook would run Apple.</p>
<p>This video was just the latest of several I have seen that feature, somewhat candid, Apple executives. Jobs tended to be far more reclusive in regards to the media, but I find being able to see the faces that lead Apple and hear their thoughts is satisfying and reassuring.</p>

<p>Many people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/obituaries/alan-rickman-dies-at-69.html">will remember Rickman</a> for his role in <em>Die Hard</em> or his stage performances, but I, and I suspect many of my peers, will remember him as one of the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/bonus-daily-cartoon-remembering-alan-rickman">best damn antagonists</a>&rdquo; our generation could ask for.</p>

      <h2>Amazon&#39;s 30-Minutes-or-Less Delivery by Drone</h2>
      <p>Yesterday, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazons-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/">sat down with Charlie Rose</a> and unveiled Amazon&rsquo;s next big step for their fulfillment centers: delivery by drone in under 30 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: These generations of vehicles, it could be a 10-mile radius from a fulfillment center. So, in urban areas, you could actually cover very significant portions of the population. And so, it won&rsquo;t work for everything; you know, we&rsquo;re not gonna deliver kayaks or table saws this way. [&hellip;] This is&hellip; this is all an R&amp;D project.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: With drones, there&rsquo;s somebody sitting somewhere in front of a screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: Not these; these are autonomous. So you give &lsquo;em instructions of which GPS coordinates to go to, and they take off and they fly to those GPS coordinates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole process is really fascinating and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BIu9dpwHU">the video</a> is even more convincing that this isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> an R&amp;D project; Bezos wants this to be a real system of delivery within the next five years.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re at home on a Friday night and order a Pizza Hut deep dish and that new Xbox game you&rsquo;ve been wanting to try from Amazon. Within 30 minutes of ordering, they&rsquo;ll both be at your door. This is cool.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of situations where an autonomous drone just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> get to places that a person can. Furthermore, there is a whole list of things that could be problematic for drone delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery for apartments</li>
<li>Delivery in the city</li>
<li>Delivery in the rain / wind / snow</li>
<li>Theft of delivery items and / or drones</li>
<li>Legally, what do I have to agree to for a drone to land on my property?</li>
<li>Drone malfunction</li>
<li>Numerous safety issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I assume Amazon won&rsquo;t show you the Prime Air option if your delivery address is outside their drones&rsquo; radius of reach, however will it also be hidden for cases of bad weather and apartment deliveries? Bezos doesn&rsquo;t answer these questions. He does say that the Prime Air project is in an early stage, and that actual delivery-by-drone is still a couple of years away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist [&hellip;] I know it can&rsquo;t be before 2015, because that&rsquo;s the earliest we could get the rules from the FAA. My guess is that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s probably a little optimistic. But could it be, you know, four, five years? I think so. It will work, and it will happen, and it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun or failure? Time will have to tell. I have no doubt that the shipping industry will be disrupted within the next ten years, but I don&rsquo;t know if drones can physically replace the agile and versatile abilities of a person on the scale that Amazon needs for this to be a viable option to most of their customers.</p>
<p>Later on in the interview, Bezos and Rose get into a more introspective discussion about Amazon as a business. Surprisingly, despite Amazon&rsquo;s behemoth presence, Bezos doesn&rsquo;t at all believe that Amazon is invincible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: Companies have short life spans Charlie. And Amazon will be disrupted one day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: And you worry about that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: I don&rsquo;t worry about it &lsquo;cause I know it&rsquo;s inevitable. Companies come and go. And the companies that are, you know, the shiniest and most important of any era, you wait a few decades and they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: And your job is to make sure that you delay that date?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: I would love for it to be after I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delaying the date to inevitable disruption. This is exactly why I&rsquo;m not sold on companies like Snapchat and the next &ldquo;hot&rdquo; startup being worth billions upon billions of dollars: if Amazon, a company that moves millions of physical goods, needs to have a delivery-by-drone R&amp;D project to &ldquo;delay&rdquo; the inevitable disruption, how much less than will it take to disrupt an app that sends pictures to your friends?</p>
<p>Not much.</p>

      <h2>An Apple a Day</h2>
      <p>Last December, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/apple-meets-with-f-d-a-regulators-for-mobile-medical-applications/">Apple executives met with the FDA to discuss mobile medical applications</a>, perhaps indicative of a growing interest surrounding health-focused devices. Nick Bilton for the <em>New York Times</em> Bits Blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the participants from Apple were Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations; Bud Tribble, vice president of software technology at Apple; Michael O’Reilly, who joined Apple last year; and an employee from Apple’s government affairs department.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some big names from Apple&rsquo;s side to say the least, which, as Bilton describes, means this was probably not a typical meeting.</p>
<p>This story will only increase the fervor surrounding a possible &ldquo;iWatch&rdquo; device, but I think that might be a bit of a stretch. Considering that Apple already has a health-focused device in the game — the iPhone 5s and its <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/10/iphone-5s-includes-new-m7-motion-coprocessor-for-health-and-fitness-tracking/">M7 Motion Coprocessor</a> — it is ostensible that Apple is just looking to better equip itself regarding the regulations and laws surrounding medical technology.</p>

      <h2>An iPad Painting of Morgan Freeman</h2>
      <p>Kyle Lambert, a talented visual artist, recently completed, what he&rsquo;s calling, &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s most realistic finger-painting&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently discovered that it was possible to create incredibly high resolution (4k) paintings using only my iPad, and I wanted to see just how far I could push digital artwork and paint a true photorealistic portrait. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The finished painting is made up of around 285,000 brush strokes and took more than 200 hours to complete. The entire process was captured as a time-lapse video by Procreate, allowing you to watch over 200 hours of painting in just 3 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could say that the iPad is incredible for having a touchscreen accuracy that allows for such detail to be achieved.</p>
<p>I could say that iOS is incredible for having so many high-quality applications that facilitate this type of artistic output.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m going to say is that people are incredible, and, given good tools, they can create amazing things. This painting also serves as a box of nails in the coffin of the iPad-isn&rsquo;t-for-content-creation argument.</p>

      <h2>Angry, Sad, Wow, Haha, Like and Love</h2>
      <p>Sarah Frier, reporting for Bloomberg Businessweek, wrote an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-facebook-reactions-chris-cox/">excellent profile on Facebook&rsquo;s Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and upcoming Facebook Reactions</a>. In addition to profiling Cox, Frier also underscores the whole story with Cox&rsquo;s latest project: Facebook Reactions—an attempt to extend the ubiquitous and iconic blue thumbs-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The like button is the engine of Facebook and its most recognized symbol. A giant version of it adorns the entrance to the company’s campus in Menlo Park, Calif. Facebook’s 1.6 billion users click on it more than 6 billion times a day—more frequently than people conduct searches on Google—which affects billions of advertising dollars each quarter. [&hellip;] But the button is also a blunt, clumsy tool. Someone announces her divorce on the site, and friends grit their teeth and “like” it. There’s a devastating earthquake in Nepal, and invariably a few overeager clickers give it the ol’ thumbs-up. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The solution would eventually be named Reactions. It will arrive soon. And it will expand the range of Facebook-compatible human emotions from one to six.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official Facebook Reactions are slated to take the form of: like, angry, sad, wow, haha, and love. Interestingly, there was supposed to be a seventh reaction, &ldquo;yay,&rdquo; but it got removed because, according to a Facebook spokesperson, &ldquo;it was not universally understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of emotional reactions as a form of social currency isn&rsquo;t anything new. Back in 2011, I was using <a href="http://path.com">Path</a>, a closed social network for small groups, and loved their Reaction-style commenting. It made Facebook&rsquo;s Like and Twitter&rsquo;s Favorite buttons look both limiting and, for certain contexts, awkward.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/hearts-on-twitter">Twitter&rsquo;s recent foray into changing Favorites into Likes</a>, which completely changed the context of the tweets being Favorited, Facebook isn&rsquo;t removing the like button, only extending it. Capping the new emotion count to six also differentiates Reactions from Slack&rsquo;s <a href="http://slackhq.com/post/123561085920/reactions">feature by the same name</a>, which allows users to select any emoji as a reaction to a message.</p>
<p>However, as one of the most used applications in the world, I was curious how Facebook planned on addressing the UI implications of adding six new emotional options to every post. Again, Frier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg had a solution: Just display the usual thumbs-up button under each post, but if someone on her smartphone presses down on it a little longer, the other options will reveal themselves. Cox’s team went with that and added animation to clarify their meaning, making the yellow emojis bounce and change expression. The angry one turns red, looking downward in rage, for example. Once people click their responses, the posts in News Feed show a tally of how many wows, hahas, and loves each generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clever. I also anticipate that you&rsquo;ll be able to tap on one of the displayed Reactions, to quickly go &ldquo;me too,&rdquo; as opposed to holding down the like button. There&rsquo;s no mention of how you&rsquo;ll interact with Reactions on the web version of Facebook, but I imagine that they&rsquo;ll make the experience very similar to what they describe for mobile.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">1.59 billion monthly active users</a> in a world of seven billion people, no new feature for Facebook is small. Back to Frier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update may seem trivial. All it’s doing is increasing the number of clickable responses. People already comment on posts with emojis or, in some cases, actual words. But the feature will probably make Facebook even more addictive. And it will certainly give Cox’s team a lot more information to throw into the News Feed algorithm, thereby making the content more relevant to users—and, of course, to advertisers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were an advertiser on Facebook, I&rsquo;m not sure Reactions would make me excited. Nervous, maybe? Until now, advertisers on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, have only had to worry about negative, text-based comments. Any one-tap reactions were always positive. With Reactions, the whole game might change.</p>
<p>Consider seeing an ad for shoes that has 100 likes next to the image. Now imagine that same ad, but with 100 likes, 50 sad faces, 25 angry faces, and so on. Will advertisers have the ability to limit the type of reactions their content receives and displays? Additionally, what about users who are just plain annoyed with ads? Negative Reactions could be a visible form of retaliation.</p>
<p>But those issues are for Facebook and the advertisers to figure out. For the users, I think Reactions are going to be a huge hit. Look no further than the absolute explosion in popularity of stickers and emojis in messaging apps. Users like to quickly and visually reply with their emotional response, and Reactions is giving them six new ways to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few readers have pointed out that another example of negative reactions appearing next to ads can be found on YouTube. Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBYWGjIzvyw">this Apple ad for the iPhone 6s</a>; located under the view count, there are 56,429 &ldquo;I like this&rdquo; thumbs-up and 9,065 thumbs-down. Not as visually distinct as Reactions will be, but still interesting. Also worth noting: viewers can&rsquo;t vote (and therefore can&rsquo;t see) any thumbs-up/down statistics on pre-video ads, which might be similar to how Facebook handles sidebar or Newsfeed advertisements.</p>

      <h2>Arms Race</h2>
      <p>Just last month, at the Mobile World Conference, Samsung <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/22/5437150/samsung-drops-android-for-tizen-in-new-gear-2-smartwatches">revealed the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo</a>, two new devices based off their original Gear smartwatch that had launched last summer. Notably, Samsung&rsquo;s latest iterations will no longer use Android as the operating system, instead opting for Tizen; a mobile os that Samsung has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">much more control over</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/sharing-whats-up-our-sleeve-android.html">announced Android Wear</a>, an extension to Android that is intended for use in &ldquo;wearables&rdquo; - specifically, smartwatches.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the announcement from Google, Motorola (midway through being sold to Lenovo, but still sporting the &ldquo;A Google Company&rdquo; moniker) announced <a href="http://moto360.motorola.com/">the Moto 360</a>, their take on what an Android Wear-powered smartwatch should be. Aside from five reasons why &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Time&rdquo; for watches to do more, there were no details in regards to price, launch date (&ldquo;coming in summer 2014&rdquo;), or styles.</p>
<p>Assumedly, Apple is also planning to launch some sort of wearable within the next year, a device <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+iwatch">the tech journalists are calling the iWatch</a>.</p>
<p>Between <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband">Nike</a>, <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/flex">Fitbit</a>, Google and Samsung, major tech companies are declaring the wrist as the next battleground for your attention.</p>
<p>Yet, all of the smartwatches, all of them, look and act in a way that I <em>expected</em> some form of wrist device to work. Everything I&rsquo;ve seen from the Gear devices and the (simulated) screens of the Moto 360 indicate a primary focus on making smartphone notifications more convenient to deal with.</p>
<p>At face value, this seems like a great way to get our eyes off of our smartphones (<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/disruptions-more-connected-yet-more-alone/">more connected, yet more alone</a> right?). Just look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrqZl2QIz0c">the Android Wear promo video</a> and the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xQ3y902DEQ">Developer Preview</a>; both of these videos depict a more agile consumer, not beholden to the chains that your smartphone has silently slipped around your productivity, but is this really a problem that needs addressing?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that smartwatches don&rsquo;t have merit, nor a place in our current lineup of electronics. However, when I look at smartwatches that primarilly focus on making the smartphone more convenient, I feel that the we&rsquo;ve missed the mark. Given the frenzy behind this new genre of devices, it is not an unrealistic possibility that companies will develop tunnel vision, focused on competing feature lists, much like the current smartphone industry.</p>
<p>Making an accessory device isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, but I feel that we are drastically reducing the potential of the &ldquo;smartwatch&rdquo; genre, by implementing easy-to-think-of, obvious features.</p>

      <h2>Assembly language love affair</h2>
      <p>I have a love / hate relationship with assembly language.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-hate">Things I hate:</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s an archaic language. Unless you are working on microchip design, you are probably never going to work with it. Assembly language programmers have to worry and keep track of every single byte of memory - you&rsquo;re minipulating it by hand. Basically, the training wheels of high-level languages like Java and C++ are off and you have to manage everything.</p>
<p>A simple statement in Java that outputs a string of text looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Not bad. You can almost read along with the code. You are calling on the System to Print Out a Line with the contents of the quotation marks. Easy enough to understand.</p>
<p>This is the same statement, written in assembly:</p>
<pre><code>.data
msg:	.asciiz	&quot;Hello, World.&quot;
.text
main:
li	$v0, 4
la	$a0, msg
syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Yup. Practically unreadable code, more machine than human, and more than four times as many lines to accomplish what we did above. Imagine coding logic into this.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-love">Things I love</h3>
<p>You may know how to drive a car, but actually understanding how the motor and pistons drive it forward is a unique insight. Although I will never, ever, program anything substantial in assembly language, I feel I am a more conscientious coder because I understand the basics.</p>
<p>That being said, assembly and I probably won&rsquo;t end up together.</p>

      <h2>Being present for prayer</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve found a really good way to pray.</p>
<p>One of my favorite times to pray is right once I wake up. Unfortunately, I have found it hard to just sit down and start praying after rising from sleep. Often my mind is full of things from the day and the literal noise around me makes it hard to empty my mind and be present for the prayer. I started experimenting a little each morning, trying to find anything I could do to help me clear my thoughts and create an open and quiet time to pray.</p>
<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
<p>Getting a decent amount of sleep is the first thing I try and do. Waking up with a headache or still feeling incredibly tired is the quickest way to kill any enthusiasm for prayer. Often my mind turns to getting a shower or preparing breakfast instead of sitting down to talk with God. Getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep really helps take down the first barriers you can encounter if you want to do morning prayer.</p>
<h3 id="push-ups">Push ups</h3>
<p>This one may seem odd in a list of things that I do to get a clear mind for prayer, but man do some morning pushups and sit-ups help clear my mind. You&rsquo;d be amazed at how quickly I wake up and focus after just one set of pushups. I feel like my brain gets a jumpstart as my heart begins pumping blood to keep up with the stress of early morning calisthenics. When I&rsquo;m done, my whole body feels present and in the now. I follow this activity with the next one.</p>
<h3 id="write-it-out">Write it out</h3>
<p>Recently I stumbled across one of the greatest things the Internet has ever provided me with. It&rsquo;s called your Morning Pages and I found it at <a href="http://www.theartistsway.com/the-basic-tools">The Artist&rsquo;s Way</a>. Their website describes Morning Pages best, so to quote their own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning. There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages&ndash; they are not high art. They are about anything and everything that crosses your mind&ndash; and they are for your eyes only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do Morning Pages by opening up <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> and emptying whatever hits my mind. I just keep typing, without regard to spelling or grammar. When I&rsquo;ve exhausted all my mind has in it, I feel so empty, so clear and focused, that I almost automatically enter into a state of prayer. I save these Morning Pages, without any edits, right into a <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">DayOne</a> journal entry. I think it will be really interesting to go back and read them all one day.</p>
<h3 id="do-it-again">Do it again</h3>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve found a way of praying in the morning that works for me, the hardest thing I know I&rsquo;ll personally run into is doing it consistently every day. I have much resolve, however, and the benefits I&rsquo;m already experiencing from praying and Morning Pages are putting a massive positive perspective on my mornings and day ahead. I&rsquo;m really excited to have found a way to start my day off awake, focused and prayerful; it sets the tone for my day in the best way possible.</p>

      <h2>Bike ride</h2>
      <p>I have to share how amazing the weather is right now. It&rsquo;s 57F on a Tuesday night at 20:54 in the evening. The campus is wet from a slight rain and residual snow, but dry enough for me to ride my bike. The sky is clear, you can see a flawless night sky, and the softest breeze flows around every building. I have a jacket and soccer pants on, but no hat or gloves. My iPhone is securely in my jacket pocket, steadily pushing out notes to my headphones.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And I ride.</p>
<p>Our campus has a gentle slope from the South, so I fix my routes to end at the top of the incline. Once there, I cease to peddle and gravity gently begins to pull me down 300 of the most peaceful yards known to man. The breeze, the temperature and the music make this a nearly euphoric experience. Once the end approaches, I pull the handles into a gentle curve, and begin another ascent.</p>
<p>I could have been doing homework.
I could have been taking care of emails.
I could have been texting my friends and family.</p>
<p>But for a brief 15 minutes, it was just God, my bike and I.</p>
<p>And my soul feels refreshed for it.</p>

      <h2>Brief Hands-On with the New iPhones</h2>
      <p>After hitting golfballs for an hour at the range with my brother, I convinced him to swing by our local Verizon Wireless store to check out the iPhone 5C and 5S. Here are some brief thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="iphone-5c">iPhone 5C</h3>
<p>Walking up to the Apple-dedicated section of the store, the first thing that catches your eye is the color of the 5C demo units. A little thicker than the current iPod Touches, the extra weight makes the plastic body feel very much like a premium device. All the buttons on the case feel solid, clicky, and consistent. The front face is essentially the same as a white iPhone 5, but with a subtle, colorful border.</p>
<p>Although not indicative of the 5C&rsquo;s future sales (which I anticipate will be really strong), my brother commented on how much more he liked the colors than the metal look of the 5S.</p>
<h3 id="iphone-5s">iPhone 5S</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable if you think the 5S looks near-identical to the iPhone 5 — it does.</p>
<p>However, once you pick it up there are some small, noticeable differences. From my brief look, Apple really nailed the colors for the metal backing in the 5S — the contrast between the face color and the back is much more distinct than with the 5. Whereas the black iPhone 5 looked like one solid color; the 5S&rsquo;s &ldquo;space gray&rdquo; back gives the device a really nice two-toned look. It&rsquo;s the small things.</p>
<p>The most noticeable feature of the 5S is the Touch ID sensor. The home button is now surrounded by a thin ring of metal with the same accent color as the phone. <em>(Also notable: the button lacks the small rounded-rectangle icon that every other iPhone / iPod Touch has.)</em> This extra attention to the home button has left it feeling extremely sturdy, and I think it will hold up much better over time than the previous ones.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-standard">A new standard</h3>
<p>If you look at the Macbook line, you see a product with two tiers: an everyday user &ldquo;air&rdquo; level and a premium &ldquo;pro&rdquo; level. The newest iPhones follow that model. The 5C (Air) is designed to be for everyone; a solid workhorse which is both fun and functional. The 5S (Pro) is the best Apple can create; the best materials and the latest technology.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the hardware design of either iPhone to change drastically over the next few years, rather we&rsquo;ll continue to get fantastic small improvements (Touch ID, better camera) and increasingly powerful software to take advantage of them.</p>

      <h2>Buckeye Boys State 2014</h2>
      <p><em>If it&rsquo;s been quiet around here, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been gone for about a 10 days. However, in my rush to leave, I forgot to leave a notice — I apologize.</em></p>
<p>Every year, I have the opportunity to work with some of the most incredible individuals I know at the American Legion&rsquo;s Buckeye Boys State (BBS) program. As a counselor, I was in charge of 40 high school juniors, 24 hours a day, for eight days. It was truly incredible to see the changes that occur and the friendships that are formed in just a week. Truly, albeit somewhat corny if you&rsquo;ve never been there, the motto &ldquo;a week to change a lifetime&rdquo; continues to hold true, year after year.</p>
<p>I count myself incredibly lucky to be a counselor at BBS. On staff are not only some of the people I most admire and respect in my life, but also some of my best friends. Now, back to work.</p>

      <h2>Building 3D with Ikea</h2>
      <p>Kirsty Parkin, <a href="http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/building_3d_with_ikea">writing for CGSociety.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, around 75% of all IKEA’s product images are CG, and they have a ‘bank’ of about 25,000 models. &ldquo;These are all created at a ridiculously high resolution,&rdquo; explains Martin, &ldquo;We render them in 4Kx4K, and they need to hold up to that resolution. We need to be able to do whatever we like with the renderings - print them on large walls in the stores if we need to. Even if most of them are only ever used on the website, they all have the capability to be printed very high-res.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first entire room image to be created in CG for one of IKEA’s catalogues was in 2010. &ldquo;There were a LOT of people involved in that image,” says Martin. “As you can imagine, the first time you do something, everyone wants to have a look! But then the catalogue after that had four or five images and it really took off.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Canceling my noise</h2>
      <p>My brother got some great noise canceling headphones a while back. I was skeptical at how well they would work, how much can earphones really cancel the noise around you, but once I tried them I was impressed. Sliding them over your ears and flipping a switch, all extra noise around me began to filter out, leaving me in silence.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how these headphones work. When you switch them on they begin to, in real time, filter out the noise around you. Any sound that appears to be persistent in the background will be tuned out, leaving the remaining sounds &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and unobtrusive.</p>
<p>I wanted to do this in my own life. I analogize the background noise I hear before switching on the headphones to the information that flows through my brain on a daily basis from my TV, the Internet and all the other mediums I use. I&rsquo;ve actively been working on becoming my own &ldquo;noise canceling&rdquo; technology; removing the unnecessary forms of distraction and extraneous information I wasn&rsquo;t even paying attention to anymore. The result has been much more time to think, write and even a little time for absolutely nothing. Just quiet.</p>
<p>I have yet to perfect this art, I still check my Facebook, email and other social networks too much for my liking, but I have reduced both the amount of time I&rsquo;m on these sites and the number of people I let ping me with their updates. I hope to continue trimming out the excess noise, as I find I&rsquo;m more productive and attentive to real life when it&rsquo;s gone. I love being plugged into the world and living on the pulse of a global community, but at a certain point I wasn&rsquo;t even listening anymore.</p>

      <h2>Celebrate The Mac</h2>
      <p>Tomorrow will mark 30 years since Steve Jobs first unveiled the original Macintosh (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY">video</a>). To help celebrate, Jonathan Zufi, the man behind the ICONIC Book I linked to a while back, has created a website called <a href="http://www.celebratethemac.com">Celebrate The Mac</a> where he has uploaded high-quality photographs of nearly every Mac from the past 30 years. Personally, my favorites are from his <a href="http://www.celebratethemac.com/classic">&ldquo;classic&rdquo; collection</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?class=1&amp;cat=41">some of the competitors of the time</a>, it is not hard to see why the Macintosh&rsquo;s design was considered beautiful.</p>

<p>When we buy stuff, the end result is we have to take care of it. Store it. Clean it. Back it up. The more stuff we have, the more work is involved and the more stressed we can become because of it. This fact is magnified when the stuff we buy is junk.</p>

<p>Exactly. All stuff has a cost, beyond that of its price tag. Invest in quality gear, and it will save you pain in the long run.</p>

      <h2>Clymer on the Apple Watch</h2>
      <p>Benjamin Clymer is the founder and editor of Hodinkee, a well-respected voice in the field of wristwatches. I&rsquo;m new to Hodinkee, but it seems I&rsquo;m late to the party. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/fashion/Hodinkee-Wristwatches-Benjamin-Clymer.html">called</a> Mr. Clymer &ldquo;the high priest of horology,&rdquo; and after browsing the site, I can see why: his writing style is clearly expressed and enjoyable, and his perspective astute. But enough about my new favorite website.</p>
<p>Mr. Clymer was invited to the Apple Event a few days ago, and he got time in the hands-on area to assess the Apple Watch.    From his piece, <a href="http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review">A Watch Guy&rsquo;s Thoughts On The Apple Watch After Seeing It In The Metal</a> on Hondinkee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This a question I&rsquo;ve been asked countless times in the media of the past few months ( / days / hours). Will anyone be trading in their Lange Double-Split for an Apple Watch? Certainly not. But, will the average Lange owner buy an Apple Watch, wear it on the weekends, and then, after a great workout with it, decide to leave it on next for a vacation to the beach, and then maybe on casual Friday to the office? It&rsquo;s possible. Apple products have a way of making someone not want to live without them, and while I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully immerse myself in the OS yesterday, what I saw was impressive. So while certainly not direct competition for haute horology watchmaking right now, the Apple Watch is absolutely competition for the real estate of the wrist, and years down the road, it could spell trouble for traditional watches even at a high level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole piece is worth your time. Mr. Clymer also included loads of great pictures from the event, in case you weren&rsquo;t able to see a combination of Apple Watch and strap that you liked. Speaking of the straps, my favorite part of Mr. Clymer&rsquo;s piece was this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple absolutely, positively, indisputably NAILED its straps and bracelets. In addition to offering a bevy of options from leather to fluoroelastomer to link bracelets to Milanese, it is here that you really see how much attention Apple was paying to the way people wear watches, and the how bad existing options were.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me very, <em>very</em> happy.</p>

      <p><img src="http://dregerkq.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20120526-012316.jpg?w=640" alt="coffeescript"></p>
<p>Today, I learned about CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>CoffeeScript is one part of the three part formula I&rsquo;m looking to learn more about. The other two parts are Ruby on Rails and Spine.js. Part of this inspiration comes from <a href="http://twitter.com/destroytoday">@destroytoday</a> and his venture into this area of web app development. I really admire his work and his tweets on the subject have been really helpful to point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>So CoffeeScript, what is it? CoffeeScript is, as they put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a little language that compiles into JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really simple. If you go to their website at <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript.org</a>, you can see some really cool demos of how CoffeeScript makes writing JavaScript much more fun. It takes a little bit of the Ruby style syntax (indentation and lack of semi-colons) and applies it to writing JavaScript.</p>
<p>I just started getting into the tutorials, but I&rsquo;ve found that “<a href="http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/">The Little Book on CoffeeScript</a>” to be a great place to start.</p>

      <h2>Cold writing</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve found that as I write papers for class, sometimes I hit a wall. This isn&rsquo;t a full case of writers block, rather I feel the enthusiasm start to fade. What was just a feverish output of thoughts to typed characters is starting to die. Eventually, I&rsquo;ve stopped writing and am looking at my cursor blink. Blink. Blink. Blink.</p>
<p>This is when I hit Command + &ldquo;N&rdquo; and open up a new document. Without thinking more than a few seconds, I start &ldquo;cold&rdquo; writing about anything I want. Stacking wood, running in the snow, listening to instrumental music - anything that comes to mind. The block is gone, my writing flame has recaptured it&rsquo;s intensity and I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;ll pound out 500 words on this new topic in the time it took me to get 200 for the first one.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m done, I return to my original document. Every single time I do, the writers block is gone and I get back to typing. This sort of &ldquo;cold writing&rdquo; to jumpstart my spirit is a great exercise. I don&rsquo;t do it every time I write a paper, however once or twice throughout the course of a longer essay is normal. I&rsquo;m not worried about the time I lose when doing these short side-articles; the small amount of time I invest to reset my thoughts and come back focused is well worth it.</p>
<p>Some of my ideas for blog posts have come from cold writing. In fact, this post you&rsquo;re reading was being written as I worked on a paper assigned for when I get back from spring break. Writing to get rid of writer&rsquo;s block, go figure.</p>

      <h2>Confessions of an appaholic</h2>
      <p><em>(Alternative title: Why I deleted my credit card from iTunes)</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it. I&rsquo;m somewhat of an appaholic. But I&rsquo;m changing that, and conquering my impulse buying at the same time.</p>
<p>iPhone apps appeal to me. They hover nicely in that psychologically-pleasing price range of .99 cents to make each purchase not sting as much as it probably should. New todo list manager? Sure, I&rsquo;ll check it out! What&rsquo;s that, it&rsquo;s like Angry Birds, except with mice and cheese? Excellent!</p>
<p>No. It has to stop.</p>
<p>For one, I&rsquo;m on a budget. Now, my definition of &ldquo;budget&rdquo; may be more loosely defined than others, but I like having money available for things that tie into life experiences. I have yet to find the real-world need to throw birds at buildings. Actually, it sounds quite cruel.</p>
<p>Secondly, it reinforces a bad habit I&rsquo;ve had since I was a little kid - impulse buying. When I was younger, any money I got was quickly exchanged for whatever Walmart happened to be selling that day. I didn&rsquo;t buy recklessly, but going into a store without a specific item of purchase in mind was the Angry Bird to my piggy bank.</p>
<p>Eventually I matured through high school and realized the value of money for things beyond that 15 to 20 dollar threshold. All was good, and then the App Store hit. Thousands upon thousands of insanely cheap outlets for my free time just a touch away. And they were too easy to buy, almost fun. One tap to change the Buy button to green, preparing for the go ahead. One more tap and you knew it was only a matter of minutes before a new toy was dropped off on your homescreen. The receipt would be emailed to you in a few days, and you ended up spending less than you would have for gas to even get you to a physical store. I may not have thought it was much money at the time, but even the smallest grains of sand, when amassed, can cover hundreds of miles of shoreline.</p>
<p>Oh, and that .99 cent app you just bought? It, with tax added on, is actually costing you $1.06 (with Ohio tax rates at least). As soon as you shove the price up above that .99 sweet spot, things get a little more realistic. I knew the only way to really give myself an edge in this battle was to cut away completely. Five minutes later in my iTunes account settings, I had found, and removed the credit card I had on file. Since it will be a hassle to add it back every time I check out a new app, I see this being a very effective deterrent. So far, it&rsquo;s working great.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to go to an extreme to help compensate for a personal weakness. Mine was impulse buying. By removing my credit card, I can&rsquo;t buy another app even if I wanted to. Drastic? Maybe a little, but if it means that I start saving a couple dollars here and there for the things that really matter to me, then it&rsquo;s worth every penny.</p>

      <h2>Creating Better Passwords</h2>
      <p>Jesse Gardner has a brilliant way to give each of your sites a unique, yet memorable, password. He does this by starting with a common &ldquo;key&rdquo; phrase or password, and then changing that key, based on the site it is being used for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The beauty of this system is that if someone hacks one of your accounts and gets your password, they’ll have a single, unique password that’s not useful anywhere else. And if you do need to go through and change your passwords (which you should do from time to time), you can either change the formula or change the key. This means that old passwords long forgotten are only a formula or random key away from being restored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gardner&rsquo;s post may seem a little complex at face value, but he has some good examples that help illustrate the methodology and how to use it. I have been using this type of system to create my own passwords for a couple years now, I even got my dad using it too, and this is definitely the best way to go.</p>

      <h2>Creative cycle</h2>
      <p>Admidst my finals, I wanted to take a break and share an excerpt from one of my papers. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s the lack of sleep, or overdose of caffeine, but I&rsquo;m particularly proud of this closing paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask any creative - writer, designer or artist - and they will tell you that their work is never done. Even in our downtime, our minds are constantly growing organic ideas planted in the soil of our experiences. As we move from project to project our skills become more refined, and allow for new avenues of opportunity to be explored. It is a never-ending cycle for those who strive to create something for the world</p>

      <h2>Day One for iOS 7</h2>
      <p>One of the ways that I chronicle my life is through the action of journaling. However, I don&rsquo;t always have time to sit down and write out long reflections on the day. Back when I was a young boy, I used to carry around little steno notebooks and write about my day <em>as it was happening</em>.</p>
<p>I still carry around <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">little notebooks</a>, but I&rsquo;ve long since moved all my journaling to the digital realm. My app of choice to help manage the 78,857 words I&rsquo;ve written over the past four years has been Day One by <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Bloom Built</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Day One has been fully updated for iOS 7, and includes some great new features to take advantage of the iPhone 5S&rsquo;s M7 processor. I&rsquo;m really excited about the new visual look, but what&rsquo;s even better is that the core formula that makes Day One great hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

      <h2>De-clutter Your Social Networks, Part One</h2>
      <p>Most things in life, left unchecked, tend to fall into chaos. I find this particularly true regarding the number and quality of the updates I receive through social networks.  The problem is that we&rsquo;ve become desensitized to the value of our own time, and we continue to add new Facebook friends or follow people on Twitter without closing off some of the existing network.</p>
<p>Imagine a pack permanently strapped to your back. For every new connection on Twitter or Facebook, small stones of various sizes get deposited into your pack. Eventually, over time, the pack will reach a point where it becomes too heavy or can&rsquo;t hold all the stones. The stones represent your online connections, with sizes proportional to the amount of information they post. The weight of the pack is the amount of your energy it takes to manage all of those connections. If we were physically laden with the weight of our own social networks, most people would start trimming.</p>
<p>However, slimming down your network is difficult, and there is no physical toll for connecting with thousands of different people. In addition, aside from the emotional elements at play, cutting down on your network often means reducing that very prominent number of current followers or friends. That damn little number, in addition to our own instinct to avoid loss whenever possible, often makes any attempt to prune a network less successful than it could have been.</p>
<p>To help myself keep things simple and manageable, I have two questions, one for Twitter and one for Facebook, I ask myself when attempting to cut back my online network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>: Has the individual&rsquo;s last few tweets been A.) of personal interest to me or B.) provided me with some form of insight I would not have gotten elsewhere? If the answer to either of these questions is &ldquo;no&rdquo; more than a few times, I unfollow the account right then and there.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: Is my Facebook connection with this person the <em>primary and only</em> method I have of contacting them? If the answer is &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then I reconsider whether we should remain connected online; the argument being that I always have more than one way to contact real friends or family members. If I never see or interact with someone I consider a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; on Facebook, yet give them access to all my information, it may be time to remove them from my friends list.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to cut back connections on either network, and often a misplaced sense of sentimentalism will show up to make the whole process even more difficult, but the benefits of a clearer mind and less social noise are worth the effort.</p>

      <p><em>I tried to sending the following message through the <a href="http://www.tinabrownmedia.com/contact-us/">Tina Brown Media</a> contact form, but the message wouldn&rsquo;t send (I assume it was exceeding the server&rsquo;s maximum number of allowed characters). Nonetheless, the remarks I am addressing took place publicly, so I feel the apology should as well.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Ms. Brown,</p>
<p>Forgive me for using the contact form intended for Women in the World, but I was unable to find any means of contacting you specifically, other than Twitter, which I avoided because of its informal nature.</p>
<p>Just last night, on March 12, you spoke at the University of Mount Union as the guest speaker for their annual Schooler Lecture Series. It was a wonderful evening, and the whole campus appreciated you taking the time to spend a day with us.</p>
<p>I am emailing you to sincerely apologize. Last night, when I got the chance to ask you a question during the lecture (&ldquo;do you plan to expand Women in the World to other areas of international news&rdquo; / &ldquo;where do you stand on the oxford comma&rdquo;), I addressed you as &ldquo;Tina&rdquo; and not, as I should have, &ldquo;Ms. Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warm, friendly nature of the onstage discussion gave me an unintentional assumed familiarity with you, and I am sorry.</p>
<p>Respect and accuracy matters, as you said last night, and I wanted to make sure you know that I regard you as one of the most well-spoken, intelligent individuals in the media today. I have nothing but admiration for your work, and I sincerely hope that my gaffe in public was not taken as a lack of respect towards you or your accomplishments.</p>
<p>I tried to catch you after our short meeting at President Giese&rsquo;s house, but I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to speak with you privately before you left. Nonetheless, I wanted to make sure I got the chance to apologize and to take an extra opportunity to thank you for visiting. I wish you all the luck with the Women in the World Summit this April, and I will be following the coverage in the news closely.</p>
<p>Thank you again,</p>

      <h2>Deleting several online accounts</h2>
      <p>This evening, I <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreger/status/714619719299567616">posted a tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instagram, Snapchat, Foursquare, IFTTT, and Medium all got the axe this past week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the expanded explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong>: This was the most difficult account to close. I joined Instagram the moment they opened registration. I remember looking at terribly faux vignette photos from Jack Dorsey, back when he was in the closed beta. I catalogued most of my college life on Instagram with an iPod Touch. Instagram was reprieve for those who loved photography but hated postproduction. With a swipe and tap, your average photo could look above average. Then things changed. The Facebook acquisition, video, Sponsored Posts, and now, algorithmic timelines. Instagram&rsquo;s values have changed, but mine haven&rsquo;t. The Instagram I loved is dead, and I&rsquo;ve been mourning for about six months too long. Time to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Snapchat</strong>: I rather enjoyed Snapchat, but it got too noisy. The novelty of seeing 50 snaps from someone&rsquo;s completely normal weekday wears off faster than whatever glue Snapchat&rsquo;s using to hold together their sham of a navigational UI.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare</strong>: Swarm got <a href="https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/swarm-4-0-ui-elements-as-brand-and-brand-as-ui-element-b8ae437a9fb3#.pvptq0gdi">a big update last week</a>, which reminded me that I still have a Foursquare account. After reseting my password, I gave the new Swarm a try, and then remembered how creepy it is to share your location with strangers. I could make my check-ins private, but I have zero friends on the service, so it&rsquo;d just be me.</p>
<p><strong>IFTTT</strong>: The only recipe I ever used would take any new Instagram photos and put a copy in my Dropbox. Considering I broke that recipe when I deleted my Instagram account, I had very little reason to continue being a member. Admittedly, IFTTT&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt/">recent squirrely behavior</a> made leaving a little easier.</p>
<p><strong>Medium</strong>: The Gentle Green Giant. I deactivated my Medium account because&hellip; honestly, I can&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s a gut feeling of cynicism, of internal conflict. I want to like Medium. They make it so easy. Custom domains: check. Analytics: check. A method of surfacing interesting content: check. Moreover, Medium&rsquo;s ethos as a sanctuary for writing couldn&rsquo;t be stronger: The President of the United States, Basecamp, and any number of writers I respect are investing heavily in the service. Yet, for every exceptional piece I&rsquo;ve read, there&rsquo;s 30 others that seem to promote the over-the-top, wiser-than-you flavor of narcissism only the deluded self-centered can cultivate — and this crap gets huge traction on Medium. It even <em>looks</em> good on Medium. Strong typography, full-bleed images, mobile ready. When everything looks important, it can be hard to tell what really is.</p>

      <h2>Describing RSS</h2>
      <p>Since running this website is part of an academic project, I have been asked, perhaps more often than usual, to describe several of the technologies that I am using. Most non-technical people can generally grasp the idea of a statically-generated site and domains / hosting, but one topic that seems to take an extra round of explaining is RSS.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Brent Simmons has a <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/01/29/describing_rss">fantastic way of explaining the protocol</a>, and its purpose, which I will be stealing for the future.</p>

      <h2>Doug Bowman (@stop) to Leave Twitter</h2>
      <p>Doug Bowman, Twitter&rsquo;s Creative Director for the past five years, is leaving the company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a cliché in our tech industry that companies and founders start with a vision that includes the grandiose notion of changing the world. What Twitter has enabled, is enabling, and will continue to enable is nothing short of just that. As Biz says, Twitter is not a triumph of technology, it is a triumph of humanity. It all comes back to people like you and me who use the service, and what we continue to do with it. There is no other platform that offers what Twitter offers, and there is no other service that continuously reveals the collective pulse of our planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He will be sorely missed; Twitter has come a long way over the past five years, and Bowman was at the helm.</p>

      <h2>DuckDuckGo!</h2>
      <p>DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search engine, just announced a new partnership with Yahoo. This partnership isn&rsquo;t necessarily new, perhaps more <em>renewed</em>, as DuckDuckGo has utilized Yahoo&rsquo;s BOSS (Build Your Own Search Service) API <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/duckduckgo-search-engine-built-boss-47461.html">for years</a>. That said, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what DuckDuckGo was going to do when Yahoo announced it was <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/">discontinuing the BOSS API earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo will continue to get results, and a few extra features like date filtering on results, from Yahoo by way of a custom integrations between each service. Here&rsquo;s the text over on the <em>Yahoo</em> subdomain <a href="https://duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net">duckduckgo-owned-server.yahoo.net</a>:</p>

      <h2>Eight days without Facebook</h2>
      <p>It&rsquo;s been eight days since [I deactivated my Facebook account]({% post_url 2012-02-02-byebye-facebook %}). After being truly logged out for more than a week, here are a few of the interesting things I&rsquo;ve noticed:</p>
<h3 id="facebook-the-40-minute-hour">Facebook: the 40 minute hour</h3>
<p>This week without Facebook may have been one of the most productive, non-exam weeks of my life. It&rsquo;s not that I was spending an inordinate amount of time on the site to begin with, but taking away the 10-20 minute visits every couple hours has been great. I&rsquo;m getting a whole lot more done.</p>
<h3 id="their-design-kinda-sucks">Their design kinda sucks</h3>
<p>I think while I was actively using the site, I put up with the quirky, inefficient layout because I needed it. Now that I don&rsquo;t, I feel the overall design is flawed. When concepts like <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ias-2006-facebook-designs-redesigned/">Information Architect&rsquo;s idea from 2006</a> exist, it&rsquo;s sad to see Facebook has gotten worse at displaying less information. Every time I look at the screen of someone logged into Facebook, it&rsquo;s like looking at the vomit of a robot who overdosed on blurry pictures and a copy of the Fake AP Stylebook.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-get-yo-number">Can I get yo number?</h3>
<p>My phone address book, sans any Facebook sync, is woefully out of date and incomplete. If I were going to return to Facebook for anything, it would be so I could use the directory of up-to-date contact information on people I actually care to communicate with. This is ignoring the, maybe larger, issue that I can no longer search for people I&rsquo;ve just met. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I relied on Facebook to keep tabs on my friends&rsquo; emails and phone numbers.</p>
<h3 id="im-more-happy">I&rsquo;m more happy</h3>
<p>This is completely subjective, but I feel more happy. I&rsquo;ve started this habit where, when I get bored, I practice coding and work on small side-projects. My old habit would have been opening a browser to check Facebook, but now I have time to do something I actually enjoy and will make me a better programmer. It&rsquo;s about reallocating my time into things that will give me long-term yield.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still adjusting to being outside the Facebook bubble. Like I mentioned, it&rsquo;s rough not having all your friends&rsquo; contact information readily available. However, most of the people I talk to these days go to school with me and are searchable in Mount&rsquo;s online directory. I&rsquo;m curious what another week logged out will show me, especially since it will be over a major holiday.</p>
<p>Short synopsis: I&rsquo;m out and don&rsquo;t have any rationale for going back.</p>

      <h2>Elie Wiesel Dies at 87</h2>
      <p>Joseph Berger for the New York Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elie Wiesel, the Auschwitz survivor who became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II and who, more than anyone else, seared the memory of the Holocaust on the world’s conscience, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He raised his voice, not just against anti-Semitism, but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all its forms,”  [President Obama] said Saturday in a statement. “He implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of ‘never again.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Set aside a couple of minutes, find a quiet spot, and read through this whole piece. Among many, many, other things, Mr. Wiesel&rsquo;s life is a testament to the awesome power our words can have.</p>

      <h2>Elon Musk on Model S Fire</h2>
      <p>After numerous reports <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0kjI08n4fg">and videos</a> of a Telsa Model S being on fire at the end of a highway off-ramp, Telsa C.E.O. Elon Musk <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/model-s-fire">commented on the company blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Model S owner was nonetheless able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system, bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury. [&hellip;] For consumers concerned about fire risk, there should be absolutely zero doubt that it is safer to power a car with a battery than a large tank of highly flammable liquid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/10/04/musk-model-s">John Gruber</a>, Musk and Telsa have a beautifully-clear, plain laguage they use when writing these types of posts; it goes a long way in building trust with consumers.</p>

      <h2>Empire&#39;s Definitive History of The West Wing</h2>
      <p>Empire has a great collection of interviews and photographs from <em>The West Wing</em>. I particularly liked this little bit from Martin Sheen, talking about creator Aaron Sorkin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SHEEN: Aaron&rsquo;s very sticky about using precise language. It&rsquo;s in his contract: you have to use what he writes! It was poetry couched in politics, but it was poetry for the common man. It made us feel that our thoughts and our emotions and our hopes and fears could be expressed in a more lofty way and be no less human. He has that extraordinary gift of making ordinary people speak in an extraordinary way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what I like the best about <em>The West Wing</em>: the characters provide an image of high intellect, but one that you felt could be attained. I&rsquo;ve already watched most of the series, but my wife and I are currently working our way through season three on Netflix. Good stuff.</p>

      <h2>Engaged</h2>
      <p>Two years ago I started
writing emails to my future fiance. Two days ago I gave her those messages as I proposed we spend the rest of our lives together. Emily is truly the most amazing young woman I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of knowing, and I&rsquo;m beyond blessed that God got us together.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who reached out over Facebook, on the phone, and in person to congratulate us both on this next step towards marriage. The response from our family and friends has been overwhelming; we&rsquo;re surrounded by such loving and amazing individuals. Seeing your excitement about our future only makes us more joyful.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank both our parents. I feel immensely blessed that they put priority on planting the seeds of faith, love, and respect in our hearts and minds as we grew up; it&rsquo;s these values that have helped Emily and I grow together so naturally. I couldn&rsquo;t be more happy - she&rsquo;s absolutely perfect for me - and the best is yet to come.</p>

      <h2>Facebook Acquires Oculus VR</h2>
      <p>To the tune of $2 billion, Facebook has acquired virtual reality and headset maker, Oculus VR. From <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/">the Facebook Newsroom</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, Inc., the leader in immersive virtual reality technology, for a total of approximately $2 billion. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus&rsquo; existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas. Given these broad potential applications, virtual reality technology is a strong candidate to emerge as the next social and communications platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971">In a wall post to his personal account</a>, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerber explained how his company sees virtual reality as a (the?) &ldquo;new&rdquo; communication platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But this is just the start. After games, we&rsquo;re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face &ndash; just by putting on goggles in your home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everyone is excited, or confused, about the acquisition. Indie game developers, who were looking forward to using Oculus&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rift&rdquo; headset prototype, are justifiably concerned about future plans for the acquisition.</p>
<p>Notably, Markus &ldquo;Notch&rdquo; Persson, the creator of <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, expressed his concern in an article titled, <a href="http://notch.net/2014/03/virtual-reality-is-going-to-change-the-world/">Virtual Reality is going to change the world</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts. Facebook is not a game tech company. Facebook has a history of caring about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers. People have made games for Facebook platforms before, and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could argue that Facebook <em>is</em> a company of grass-roots enthusiasts, given their last two acquisitions of companies that fit the &ldquo;grass-roots&rdquo; bill. However, this logic only works if Facebook keeps both WhatsApp (~$19 billion) and Oculus VR as independent companies — something that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at this, the world&rsquo;s largest social network just bought the world&rsquo;s first (truly) consumer-focused virtual reality company. An odd combination to be sure, but one that is indicative of Facebook&rsquo;s determined march towards becoming <em>the</em> company that powers the world&rsquo;s communication.</p>

      <p>Very similar to Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apps/find-my-friends/">Find My Friends app</a>, but powered by your existing Facebook network. The feature is explicitly opt-in, which should help placate some of the, inevitable, privacy-focused backlash.</p>

      <h2>Facebook Plans to Introduce Auto-Playing Video</h2>
      <p>Emil Protalinski, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/03/13/facebook-introduces-15-second-premium-video-ads-auto-play-without-sound-stop-scroll-past">writing for <em>The Next Web</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook today <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Premium-Video-Ads-on-Facebook">introduced</a> 15-second video ads, which will start playing without sound as they appear on screen and stop if you scroll past. If you tap the video, it will expand into a full-screen view with sound. The company says users can expect to start seeing these new ads &ldquo;over the next few months.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook is not the first to bring auto-play videos to mobile devices — both Instagram and Vine did the same last year. However, I don&rsquo;t like this trend where companies automatically download videos over a cellular data connection, eating through our monthly data caps. All of the aforementioned apps give options to disable auto-play when not on Wi-Fi, but that setting should be what we have to <em>opt-out</em> of, not opt-in to.</p>

      <h2>Facebook Reactions</h2>
      <p>Sarah Frier, reporting for Bloomberg Businessweek, wrote an <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-facebook-reactions-chris-cox/">excellent profile on Facebook&rsquo;s Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and upcoming Facebook Reactions</a>. In addition to profiling Cox, Frier also underscores the whole story with Cox&rsquo;s latest project: Facebook Reactions—an attempt to extend the ubiquitous and iconic blue thumbs-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The like button is the engine of Facebook and its most recognized symbol. A giant version of it adorns the entrance to the company’s campus in Menlo Park, Calif. Facebook’s 1.6 billion users click on it more than 6 billion times a day—more frequently than people conduct searches on Google—which affects billions of advertising dollars each quarter. [&hellip;] But the button is also a blunt, clumsy tool. Someone announces her divorce on the site, and friends grit their teeth and “like” it. There’s a devastating earthquake in Nepal, and invariably a few overeager clickers give it the ol’ thumbs-up. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The solution would eventually be named Reactions. It will arrive soon. And it will expand the range of Facebook-compatible human emotions from one to six.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official Facebook Reactions are slated to take the form of: like, angry, sad, wow, haha, and love. Interestingly, there was supposed to be a seventh reaction, &ldquo;yay,&rdquo; but it got removed because, according to a Facebook spokesperson, &ldquo;it was not universally understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of emotional reactions as a form of social currency isn&rsquo;t anything new. Back in 2011, I was using <a href="http://path.com">Path</a>, a closed social network for small groups, and loved their Reaction-style commenting. It made Facebook&rsquo;s Like and Twitter&rsquo;s Favorite buttons look both limiting and, for certain contexts, awkward.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/hearts-on-twitter">Twitter&rsquo;s recent foray into changing Favorites into Likes</a>, which completely changed the context of the tweets being Favorited, Facebook isn&rsquo;t removing the like button, only extending it. Capping the new emotion count to six also differentiates Reactions from Slack&rsquo;s <a href="http://slackhq.com/post/123561085920/reactions">feature by the same name</a>, which allows users to select any emoji as a reaction to a message.</p>
<p>However, as one of the most used applications in the world, I was curious how Facebook planned on addressing the UI implications of adding six new emotional options to every post. Again, Frier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg had a solution: Just display the usual thumbs-up button under each post, but if someone on her smartphone presses down on it a little longer, the other options will reveal themselves. Cox’s team went with that and added animation to clarify their meaning, making the yellow emojis bounce and change expression. The angry one turns red, looking downward in rage, for example. Once people click their responses, the posts in News Feed show a tally of how many wows, hahas, and loves each generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clever. I also anticipate that you&rsquo;ll be able to tap on one of the displayed Reactions, to quickly go &ldquo;me too,&rdquo; as opposed to holding down the like button. There&rsquo;s no mention of how you&rsquo;ll interact with Reactions on the web version of Facebook, but I imagine that they&rsquo;ll make the experience very similar to what they describe for mobile.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">1.59 billion monthly active users</a> in a world of seven billion people, no new feature for Facebook is small. Back to Frier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update may seem trivial. All it’s doing is increasing the number of clickable responses. People already comment on posts with emojis or, in some cases, actual words. But the feature will probably make Facebook even more addictive. And it will certainly give Cox’s team a lot more information to throw into the News Feed algorithm, thereby making the content more relevant to users—and, of course, to advertisers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were an advertiser on Facebook, I&rsquo;m not sure Reactions would make me excited. Nervous, maybe? Until now, advertisers on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, have only had to worry about negative, text-based comments. Any one-tap reactions were always positive. With Reactions, the whole game might change.</p>
<p>Consider seeing an ad for shoes that has 100 likes next to the image. Now imagine that same ad, but with 100 likes, 50 sad faces, 25 angry faces, and so on. Will advertisers have the ability to limit the type of reactions their content receives and displays? Additionally, what about users who are just plain annoyed with ads? Negative Reactions could be a visible form of retaliation.</p>
<p>But those issues are for Facebook and the advertisers to figure out. For the users, I think Reactions are going to be a huge hit. Look no further than the absolute explosion in popularity of stickers and emojis in messaging apps. Users like to quickly and visually reply with their emotional response, and Reactions is giving them six new ways to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few readers have pointed out that another example of negative reactions appearing next to ads can be found on YouTube. Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBYWGjIzvyw">this Apple ad for the iPhone 6s</a>; located under the view count, there are 56,429 &ldquo;I like this&rdquo; thumbs-up and 9,065 thumbs-down. Not as visually distinct as Reactions will be, but still interesting. Also worth noting: viewers can&rsquo;t vote (and therefore can&rsquo;t see) any thumbs-up/down statistics on pre-video ads, which might be similar to how Facebook handles sidebar or Newsfeed advertisements.</p>

      <h2>Fiftyfootshadows.net iOS 7 Parallax Wallpaper Pack</h2>
      <p>John Carey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, it took me a little longer than I had expected but here we go. The fiftyfootshadows parallax wallpaper pack for iOS devices running iOS 7. After quite a bit of research and trial and error I have settled on what I believe to be the optimal resolutions for iOS 7. Barring any major changes these images should leave you set for a good long while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carey has two sets of 30 images (for iPad and iPhone) available right now on his post for free, and he&rsquo;s also got 100-image collections for each device available at just $7 apiece, or $10 if you want both. All images are cropped a little bigger than the device&rsquo;s screen, meaning the parallax-tilt effect will work fine.</p>
<p>Carey&rsquo;s site was one of my [top places to get great desktop wallpapers](%{ post_url /archives/2013-09-15-great-desktop-wallpaper-sources %}), and today he&rsquo;s raised his own bar even higher. I&rsquo;ll be switching wallpapers for the rest of the day now, if only I could choose which one I like the best.</p>

      <h2>Firewatch launches tomorrow on PS4, Windows, Mac, and Linux for $19.99</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this game for two years, and it&rsquo;s almost here. I&rsquo;ll be covering the reviews that get released today, but I&rsquo;ll omit anything from <em>my commentary or the pull-quotes</em> that might spoil unreleased details about the game.</p>
<p>For the unaware, <em>Firewatch</em> is the first game from <a href="https://panic.com/">Panic</a>-backed game studio, <a href="http://www.camposanto.com/">Campo Santo</a>. Aside from the art style, which looks incredible, I&rsquo;m most excited to work my way through the story. From the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/383870">Steam game page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor Delilah is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—your only contact with the world you&rsquo;ve left behind. But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the forest, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, I&rsquo;ll be buying my copy for PS4. If you plan on buying the game on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you can still take advantage of a 10% discount by <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/383870">pre-ordering the game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like PS4 users can get a 10% discount by purchasing <em>Firewatch</em> on release day. You are officially out of reasons to not buy this game.</p>

      <h2>Firewatch Review</h2>
      <p><em><img src="http://www.camposanto.com/external/wallpapers/keyart/2560x1600.jpg" alt="firewatch"></em></p>
<p><em>Firewatch</em> is a short game. It only takes a couple of hours to play through, and there isn&rsquo;t a lot of replayability. Over the course of three days, an hour or two a night, my wife and I played <em>Firewatch</em> to completion.</p>
<p>We purchased and played <em>Firewatch</em> on our PS4. At times, I noticed small performance dips, particularly in areas with an overabundance of trees (<em>sigh</em>, foliage), but those moments were few and far between, and I&rsquo;ve read that a future patch will address performance issues.</p>
<p>I believe reviews should be upfront about their recommendations, so here it is: you should buy and play <em>Firewatch</em>. Even if walkabout adventure games don&rsquo;t interest you, Panic and Campo Santo have produced a combination of gameplay and presentation that you&rsquo;ve likely never seen before.</p>
<p>In an industry of Triple-A titles and blockbuster marketing campaigns, <em>Firewatch</em>, which seems to relish its normalcy, isn&rsquo;t just rare, it&rsquo;s respite.</p>
<h2 id="visuals-and-voice-acting">Visuals and Voice acting</h2>
<p>The game world is awe-inspiring, but doesn&rsquo;t try to trick you into thinking it&rsquo;s the real thing. Campo Santo did a fantastic job of shaping an art style that is one part polygon, one part clay, which results in this soft, digitally distinct type of visual. It&rsquo;s great. You&rsquo;re going to catch yourself just staring at a few of the landscapes and forest scenes. Some of the views are even worthy of printing out, and the PC version of <em>Firewatch</em> lets you do just that.</p>
<p>Equally as stimulating is the voice acting. Rich Sommer (Henry) and Cissy Jones (Delilah) out distance their scripts and give a performance that is raw and intoxicating. Meandering through the woods in silence, your anxiety increases with the amount of time Delilah doesn&rsquo;t radio in over your walkie-talkie. When she does, it&rsquo;s relief.</p>
<p>Throughout your conversations, you&rsquo;re in control of Henry&rsquo;s responses. Every time a dialogue prompt comes up, you&rsquo;re given an indicator as to how much time you have to answer. It forces you to maintain the tempo of conversation. Or not. Sometimes Delilah would ask stupid questions (she drinks, from time to time), and I&rsquo;d ignore her with silence.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-outdoors">Navigating the outdoors</h2>
<p>Some folks have called <em>Firewatch</em> a walking simulator. That&rsquo;s fair. You do a decent amount of walking around, but navigating the environment takes a little more effort than in most games. There&rsquo;s no persistent mini-map that shows you your location. In order to get your bearings, Henry must pull out his paper map, which tends to bend and flap slightly as you hold it. That might sound irritating, but it&rsquo;s not. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get good at identifying landmarks and certain rock formations that lead to and from your lookout tower.</p>
<p>One peculiar crutch <em>Firewatch</em> gives you is a pulsing indicator on the map that represents your current location. You can turn this off in the settings, if you wish. I would have loved to hear the conversations about why they chose to turn the indicator on by default.</p>
<p>The other navigational tool at your disposal is a compass, and it&rsquo;s as simple a compass as you&rsquo;ll find. North, South, East, West. Spin around to face the direction you want to head and off you go.</p>
<p>Interestingly, albeit obviously, you can&rsquo;t jog while holding open the map, only walk. You can jog with just the compass, which makes some of the longer, more complicated treks easier to make.</p>
<p>Pull up map, orient with compass, go. A walking simulator for sure, but a cathartic one no doubt.</p>
<p>This leads to an important aspect of <em>Firewatch</em>: the navigation and conversation never pauses the game. Aside from tinkering with the settings or viewing archived notes you&rsquo;ve saved, the game never stops. <em>Firewatch</em> takes great care in making sure the traditional meta-tasks of a game like this don&rsquo;t take away from the realism of the situation you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a number of reviews that said the ending didn&rsquo;t live up to what the narrative had built. I disagree. I think that Firewatch is a humble story, a human tale, and the climax of the plot was true to that end.</p>
<p>In my library of adventure titles, <em>Firewatch</em> would be the comic book. It&rsquo;s a short story, and it takes place shortly after a troubled origin for our hero. There aren&rsquo;t volumes of backstory, and there aren&rsquo;t pages of dialogue. That said, a story isn&rsquo;t considered good, just because it is long. In <em>Firewatch</em>, even the more mundane conversations carry a sense of intentionality. Like a comic book, the entire story is framed against an art style that not only complements the dialogue, but also offers far more subtext than any footnote could.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-buy">Conclusion: buy</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking yourself if <em>Firewatch</em> is worth $20. I say yes. I&rsquo;d say yes at $30. What <em>Firewatch</em> lacks in length, it makes up for in visuals and voice acting, both of which are some of the best I&rsquo;ve experienced in a video game.</p>
<p>Nothing that Panic and Campo Santo have done here is unique to <em>Firewatch</em> — you&rsquo;ll find bits of presentation and gameplay from other titles. Yet, the way it&rsquo;s all packaged up is what makes playing <em>Firewatch</em> so good. Like a great comic book, it won&rsquo;t take you all day to finish the story, but the emotional impact will hang around, long after you&rsquo;ve left the Wyoming wilderness.</p>

<p>You may have read about Sanmay Ved, a researcher from who was able to buy google.com for one minute on Google Domains. Our initial financial reward to Sanmay—$ 6,006.13—spelled-out Google, numerically (squint a little and you’ll see it!). We then doubled this amount when <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-rewarded-the-guy-who-bought-googlecom-2015-10">Sanmay donated his reward to charity</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t a system error that let Mr. Ved register Google.com, given Google paid him to get the domain back, why wasn&rsquo;t it set to automatically renew in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>Google: DeepMind AI &ldquo;AlphaGo&rdquo; Masters the Ancient Game of Go.</strong> First off, this has nothing to do with Go, Google&rsquo;s programming language (also referred to as Golang to prevent confusion). Rather, Google has developed a Go-playing AI that went 5-0 against reigning 3-time European champion, Fan Hui. Google&rsquo;s David Silver and Demis Hassabis, <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">writing for the Google Research Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We first trained the policy network on 30 million moves from games played by human experts, until it could predict the human move 57% of the time (the previous record before AlphaGo was 44%). But our goal is to beat the best human players, not just mimic them. To do this, AlphaGo learned to discover new strategies for itself, by playing thousands of games between its neural networks, and gradually improving them using a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning. This approach led to much better policy networks, so strong in fact that the raw neural network (immediately, without any tree search at all) can defeat state-of-the-art Go programs that build enormous search trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bit from Elizabeth Gibney, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/google-ai-algorithm-masters-ancient-game-of-go-1.19234">reporting for Nature</a>, also touched on a difficulty in AI that I hadn&rsquo;t thought much about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis] says that many challenges remain in DeepMind’s goal of developing a generalized AI system. In particular, its programs cannot yet usefully transfer their learning about one system — such as Go — to new tasks; a feat that humans perform seamlessly. “We’ve no idea how to do that. Not yet,” Hassabis says.</p>

      <h2>Fitbit HR Review Transcript</h2>
      <p>The Fitbit HR is a good fitness tracker. It&rsquo;s comfortable, has acceptable battery life, and the software is easy to use. Although the Fitbit HR device only shows your information, the accompanying app can show aggregated data from your friends, which provides passive, and surprisingly compelling, encouragement to log a few extra hundred steps.</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher B. Durr and I wanted to record a review of our Fitbit HRs, but we couldn&rsquo;t find time to do so. What we ended up doing was opening a blank Google Doc, and then taking turns typing in our own transcripts.</p>
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="august-2015">August 2015</h2>
<p><strong>Christopher B. Durr:</strong> I guess we should start with a pretty simple question: Why did you want a FitBit? Aside from your susceptibility to 21st century marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Dreger:</strong> It&rsquo;s “Fitbit.” Don’t capitalize the “b.”</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> “Editor”-in-Chief fits you well.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> I was always interested in tracking the quantifiable parts of my health. iOS 8 worked pretty well when it came to step counts, but it wasn’t as accurate with sleep or heart rate, there was a lot of manual logging involved. The Fitbit is a set-it-and-forget it type of thing. Which works well for my 21st century mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I’ve always thought that the Fitbit philosophy, and wearable tech in general, combined our generation’s two favorite things: data analytics and ourselves.</p>
<p>OK, maybe only a few of us are really excited about data analytics, but we have to admit we’re a bit vain.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> It&rsquo;s interesting that our generation has grown up with the ability to quantify almost everything we do. Consider Instagram, Facebook, any social media: they all have their own metric. It’s ostensible that as this biotech market expands, we’re going to want the same sort of insight. It also helps with the gamification of the whole thing. I don’t know if it’s vanity — you could argue it is — but I think that we’re just so <em>used</em> to having the numbers there, it wouldn’t feel complete without them. I’d love to ask a doctor what they think about the  patients having detailed, historic vital data before they even hit the examination room.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Gamification is good term for it. (It’s like <a href="https://youtu.be/tiXQu0Yqr9o">Ron Swanson’s Chuck E. Cheese quote</a> from &ldquo;Parks and Recreation.&rdquo; Only with Fitbit, it’s all about badges and rubbing your own success in your friend’s (read: KD’s) face when you beat them in walking.</p>
<p><em>Full disclosure, I haven’t beaten anyone at walking since I’ve had the device.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> It’s a powerful concept. For as much as it feels like a gimmick, I actually did go out for a run one night, because you had closed the gap on our step counts.</p>
<p>But stepping back, I got my Fitbit Charge HR from my wife for my birthday. You, however, went out and bought one, after seeing mine in action over vacation. Talk about that a bit, because I thought you were undecided at that point.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I wasn’t entirely sold on the idea of wearable tech. About a dozen times in my life, I’ve  decided to start wearing a watch. My current record is six consecutive days. I had very little faith I’d stick with the Fitbit.</p>
<p>That being said, I’ve logged my meals into the MyFitnessPal app for something like 364 days in a row, so I figured I’d give it a go.</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s stuck so far is I’m applying my OCD from MyFitnessPal to Fitbit, and the whole thing just gets perpetuated. It is certainly not <em>just</em> a watch, although I think it does play the part quite well.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> “Quite well” might be a little too generous. I think it’s an OK watch.</p>
<p>This is related to a general issue I with wearables that are meant to replace a watch. In most cases, to save battery, the wearable won’t stay on unless you actually interact with them. Even the Fitbit won’t keep the screen lit for more than ~10 seconds or so. This makes it cumbersome to do things that require short yet precise time tracking. Things like brewing coffee in my AeroPress, or checking my pulse. I know this is nitpicking, but it bugs the crap out of me.</p>
<p>(<em>Editor&rsquo;s note: At the time of writing, Fitbit briefly released, then pulled, a software update for the Fitbit HR. This update let the HR&rsquo;s screen be activated with a tilt of the wrist, rather than physically tapping on the device. Durr managed to get the update, before it was pulled.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> As I’m one of the few to have the tilt functionality, I can tell you that it changes everything. It makes this pedometer on your wrist a legitimate timepiece. (Except for at night when tilting the wrong way will instantly blind your wife.)</p>
<p>Wait for the update and let me know what you think, Father Time.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Fair. I just like that most traditional watches function as timers and timepieces constantly and simultaneously, without any extra button presses or interaction. It’s an omnipresent feature. I understand the tradeoffs, but I guess I’m not completely sold on this one yet.</p>
<p>I am completely sold on the battery life, however. It lasts for much longer than I expected, and the charging process is crazy fast. I plug mine into our PS4 while watching Netflix, and it’s near full by the end of an episode or two.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> “I plug my Fitbit into my PS4 while we watch Netflix.” Let’s come back to that quote in 10 years and see if it feels dated.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> “Dad, what’s a Netflix?”</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> “It was a streaming service we used before the government found a way to beam media straight into our minds, son.”</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> I would so do that with books instead of digital media. But books can be a separate topic. Moving on.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I agree that the battery is great. (So far, I like to judge battery life by how it performs over months and years.) The charging mechanism is also straight forward and quick.</p>
<p>For me though, in terms of design, everything seems polished. Slick look, nice interface, minimal clutter. And the big key is it&rsquo;s comfortable. I hardly notice it anymore. Even when I sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Agreed. It’s very comfortable. I rarely take it off, except to charge and before a shower. It’s not technically waterproof, I believe that they call it “water resistant.” To that end, my anecdotal-don’t-send-me-the-bill-if-it-breaks-yours story is  I wore it in the ocean and pool every day for a week, and it was fine. Looking back, it was interesting to see that my heart rate peak with the big waves, then drop with the calmer ones.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Reader: Don’t let “big waves” fool you; he was on a Finding Nemo boogie board.</p>
<p>But we digress.</p>
<p>The heart rate monitor is excellent and definitely worth the upgrade (from the regular non-HR Fitbit), however the heart rate data is hampered a bit by the app in that I can’t zoom into the trend beyond a 24 hour period. It&rsquo;s just a lot jammed into the screen.</p>
<p>(<em>Editor&rsquo;s note: Fitbit has since released a software update that lets you drill down into a 24 hour period for heart rate data.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="48-hours-later">48 hours later</h2>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> So, this “Workweek Hustle” competition we’re in is intense. I could not go to bed last night knowing that you were ahead of me in steps, so I went out and ran a 1.5 miles at 10:45pm. Not the best idea with a stomach full of lasagna, but totally worth it for the “Dreger takes the lead!” notification.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> See that is why you’ll win 99% of these Workweek Hustles. I’m an old man. I want to curl up with a nice book and forget that running is a thing.</p>
<p>One of these weeks I will be victorious though. On a totally separate note, do you have any major surgeries planned?</p>
<h2 id="72-hours-later">72 hours later</h2>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> So, we left this for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Day jobs are funny that way.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> And in the meantime, I bought, then returned, an Apple Watch. But that’s for another review.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Your Fitbit probably knew you were cheating.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Doubtful, I hid the Fitbit in my dresser. Anyhow, I finally got that software update, and the tilt-for-time feature is really nice. Unfortunately, my brief time with Apple Watch spoiled me; Apple&rsquo;s tilt sensing is just better.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> That extra $400 had to go towards something I guess. I think the Fitbit admirably performs the tilt feature. Though, I do find myself flicking my wrist in an exaggerated manner sometimes, which makes me look even more dumb than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> What do you like about the physical build / comfortableness?</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Like anything, it takes some time to get used to, but overall, it’s really comfortable and about as discreet as they come. Obviously I’m not a fashion expert (as evident by my college T-shirt collection), but I think it “goes” with most everything.</p>
<p>For $149, everything feels well made, which I greatly appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Agreed. It has good build quality, and the strap material is lovely. Also, it’s not too bulky, so I can wear it with anything semi-casual. If I need to wear anything that requires a tie, I&rsquo;ll probably forego the Fitbit.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Ah, good. That means I’ll out-step you at your brother’s wedding next month.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> I wonder when we stop seeing people without something on their wrist? Like that awkward, social ostracizing that happens when you first met someone who doesn&rsquo;t have an iPod (2000) or cell phone (2008).</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> That’s a good point, but I’m sure there were people who said the same thing when Google Glass came out. Now in 2015, my glasses don’t have a HUD, and when I tell them to take a video, people around me get up and move.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Google Glass never really made it to consumer market, though. Especially not at $1,500 a pop.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Certainly the Fitbit is an easier sell than Google Glass, I’ll give you that. The barrier to entry is much lower, and the technology is almost as worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> This type of wearable technology, do you think this is just a fad? Where is Fitbit in five years? Consider that they just had their IPO.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I don’t know if it’s a fad. My gut says it’s not, simply because it’s taking a technology and basically making it better. It’s essentially a much more versatile watch. Though, I probably have a calculator watch collecting dust somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> That’s what I’m really curious about: what’s the trajectory of this whole industry? I think we’re becoming increasingly aware of the benefits self-monitoring technology brings, but there’s still this huge disconnect between the data and the experts who can interpret it. I can have all the data I want, but I’m not necessarily trained to discern more than “more steps = good.” When will this data a.) get accurate enough to actually be reliable, and b.) be easily accessible by my doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I don’t know if the medical community will want anyone to have reliable access to the data. We’re already a society of hypochondriacs, thanks to Dr. Google and WebMD.</p>
<p>However, I know some companies give employees better insurance premiums for wearing them and living a healthier lifestyle. The issue cuts both ways.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> The issue is that we won&rsquo;t know whether, for the general population, having access to this kind of personal health data makes a difference. Is it enough to curve eating habits, encourage active lifestyles, etc. Right now, we’re all walking more and being coerced into late night runs by social peer pressure, but how long will that last? The problem with “gaming” any type of thing is that the effect eventually wears off. I’m playing one hell of a devil’s advocate right now, but it’s worth noting.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I agree that the effect will get tired for most, but I think the passive act of wearing it will help in the long run. Maybe you won’t be walking around your apartment to get those last 800 steps, but if it gets you out of your seat two or three more times a day, that&rsquo;s something. I wouldn’t be surprised if jewelers get into the game, once the technology gets smaller. You could just be wearing a regular watch that did biometrics in the background. Heck one day it could be woven into your clothing. A lot can change in five years.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> The clothing part really interests me. We don&rsquo;t have to wear a watch, but clothes are relatively essential.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> I own exactly one expensive shirt, and every time I wash it, I worry I’ll ruin it. I can only imagine if it was wearable tech.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Just throw it on the delicate cycle, and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<h2 id="five-months-later">Five months later</h2>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> So wait, we never actually gave a recommendation for this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> We should. You first.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> It&rsquo;s a great little device for the price.</p>
<p><strong>Durr:</strong> Same. I haven&rsquo;t taken it off for more than a day since I got it. I&rsquo;d buy again.</p>

      <h2>Folded heart</h2>
      <p>Every day, once I get back from classes, I go through all the loose papers that I accumulated for that day and organize them into spiral notebooks according to their subject. Because I rarely have time to do this in class, I often fold the papers I receive in half so they better fit into the pockets of my bag.</p>
<p>A couple days ago, however, I changed the way I fold these papers. Before, I would always fold them so that the content was on the inside, protected from the abuse it might be subject to in my bag. This works great in theory, but once you start having to organize lots of loose folded paper, you realize how tedious it is to unfold each one to find out where it belongs. To fix this, I now fold my papers with the content on the outside. This allows me to quickly see where it should be sorted to when I organize at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I started to draw analogies between my papers and the way people express themselves and their faith.</p>
<p>Some people get wrapped up in themselves, focusing all their energy inward. This allows them to feel safe (who cares if the backside of a paper gets dirty?), but prevents them from ever sharing who they really are with others. They lose the opportunity to help others, given that they&rsquo;re not even looking beyond their own thoughts and needs.</p>
<p>The other type of person shares their heart outwardly. It&rsquo;s more of a risk, opening yourself up to the world, and you may even get a little roughed up for it, but ultimately this is what God wants us to do. It makes it that much easier for Him to work through us when we&rsquo;re open to begin with.</p>
<p>Which way do you fold?</p>

      <h2>Foolish Reporting of the Week: Brad Reed</h2>
      <p>Brad Reed, writing for <em>BGR</em>, wins this week&rsquo;s <em>Foolish Reporting</em> award for his ridiculously misleading headline writing. The headline in question? &ldquo;iPhone user hates iOS 7 so much that he&rsquo;s suing Apple over it&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brighter colors and flat icons just aren&rsquo;t for everybody. That said, it seems that iPhone user Mark Menacher hates them much more than anyone else. CNET reports that Menacher has actually filed a suit against Apple in small claims court and is asking the company to let him remove the iOS 7 install file from his iOS devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything in this article would have you believe that Menacher hates iOS 7 so much that he&rsquo;s willing to sue Tim Cook over it. But that&rsquo;s a lie. From the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57608171-37/apple-taken-to-court-over-unwanted-ios-7-install-download/">original article on the case</a> by Josh Lowensohn for <em>CNET</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark Menacher, a resident of Poway, Calif., filed <a href="http://courtindex.sdcourt.ca.gov/CISPublic/casedetail?casenum=201300313457&amp;casesite=KM&amp;applcode=C">a small-claims complaint</a> against Apple&rsquo;s CEO Tim Cook in the Superior Court of California in San Diego on Thursday, asking for the removal of the iOS 7 install file &ndash; something that&rsquo;s downloaded to devices automatically when they&rsquo;re connected to power and a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>iOS 7 didn&rsquo;t even install on Menacher&rsquo;s device, so how could he hate it? He never said he did. Rather, he&rsquo;s upset that the installer file takes up more than 1 GB of space and was downloaded automatically — a legitimate complaint.</p>

      <p>John Walker, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/08/wot-i-think-firewatch/">writing for Rock Paper Shotgun</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a certain point you find a disposable cardboard camera with most of its film still available, and are encouraged by Delilah to take some snaps of anything you find interesting. And it’s worth doing so, because as well as a nice little surprise toward the end, once you’ve filled your film a menu option becomes available to have them processed and delivered to your real-world house as glossy photographs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over at Polygon, Ben Kuchera <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/8/10940370/firewatch-photos-hey-there-delilah">has how this feature came to be</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This was a good moment in the Panic/Campo relationship,&rdquo; Panic&rsquo;s Cabel Sasser told Polygon. [&hellip;] &ldquo;Steven, the other co-founder here at Panic, offhandedly says &lsquo;Man, what if you could print out your disposable camera photos somehow&rdquo;, and, well, here we are. When there’s an idea that immediately excites us both — like the idea behind <em>Firewatch</em> in the first place — it’s hard to stop us from doing it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only available for Windows, Mac, and Linux to start, but Sasser says they are &ldquo;investigating what it would take to make this happen on the PlayStation 4.&rdquo; Such a unique and fantastic feature.</p>
<p>Also, I think it says something about Panic&rsquo;s and Campo Santo&rsquo;s pride in the visuals of <em>Firewatch</em> that they not only encourage in-game photography, but also went and built a way for you to print your photos out.</p>

      <h2>Frank Chimero&#39;s New Personal Website</h2>
      <p>Frank Chimero, one of the veterans of web design and a personal hero of mine, just <a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/make-it-homely/">took the wraps off his new website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, here we are: aesthetics, content, and purpose all lined up. Make it colorful, make it boxy, make it a little cluttered. Fill it with things that you love, and for god’s sake, Frank, get all of your stuff in one place so people can find it, and you can feel a bit of pride about the things you’ve made and collected. So, if you go down through the navigation, you could see it as an index of my work and passions. Success!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His new design is one that harkens back to when personal websites looked, and felt, personal. It has color, character, and feels like a home — not a museum.</p>
<p>As I talked about in 003 of The Log, I&rsquo;ve always struggled with designing something personal for my own website. I tend to stick with the more &ldquo;minimalistic&rdquo; designs that, although good in some cases, tend to resemble a majority of other websites out there.</p>
<p>Hats off to Mr. Chimero for this great redesign; I truly enjoyed <em>looking</em> around a website, instead of just consuming.</p>

      <h2>Front page design</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with how best to structure the front page of sites that have a focus on writing. The front page is the first impression, a digital handshake, and ensuring it conveys your content in a way you want is extremely important.</p>
<p>A number of different conventions exist for listing news-related content. However, most styles are based on one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Present a list of all the posts, much like an archive. Clicking on the post title will take the reader to a single-page view where the individual post lives. We&rsquo;ll call this type of design <em>conservative</em>.</li>
<li>Provide the latest 10-20 posts with full-text. Clicking on a post title will still take the reader to an individual page, but content is never hidden behind an extra click. I&rsquo;ll refer to this design type as <em>liberal</em>.</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From a news and journalistic standpoint, the liberal type of design makes the most sense. As the writer, you don&rsquo;t want the reader to have to perform multiple clicks to begin reading your latest post, and the average length of most posts (from the blogs I follow) is short enough to allow the visitor to quickly scroll through a handful of articles and get a feeling of the recent news. There is a very natural feeling that accompanies this type of design.</p>
<p>Another subset of writers I follow use an archive-as-front-page presentation. This conservative approach initially discourages the binging on content that the liberal design encourages. However, the tradeoff brings a better high-level view of what new content has arrived since the readers&rsquo; last visit. The conservative presentation puts some of the power back into the hands of the reader; as they will only have to scroll through or read a post if they initiate, not because they have to.</p>
<p>Now, the main question that I&rsquo;ve been alluding to: What type of readers do you want to attract?</p>
<p>Take Michael Lopp, of <a href="http://randsinrepose.com"><em>Rands in Repose</em></a>, who has written some truly great (and long) pieces. Lopp&rsquo;s most recent design iteration is one that puts emphasis on his latest essay, and although the new design will be used by existing readers, any new visitors are subliminally shown — by way of large typography and minimal cruft around the article text — that the primary focus of <em>Rands in Repose</em> is long-form reading and writing.</p>
<p>Devil&rsquo;s advocate: Would someone still read Lopp&rsquo;s writing if his front page was a conservative approach, with a long list of chronologically-ordered post titles? Sure. But writers like Lopp and the others I&rsquo;ve mentioned above (myself included) are acutely concerned with the <em>experience</em> that our visitors read our content in. The designs we choose to implement are intimately tied with our goals for both the site and our writing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As for my goals, I am willing to sacrifice an engaging front page for one that sits more closely to the intersection of timely and timeless content. Not all my posts are long — some are only a few sentences long — but I want each piece to have the privilege of being the exclusive focus of an entire page. My front page currently lists every article that I&rsquo;ve ever written, and clicking on a given title will take the reader to simple, and focused reading environment; I even remove unnecessary navigation links when not on the front page.</p>
<p>Hopefully this conservative approach helps me attract the type of reader who appreciates being able to quickly scan for items of interest, and then read those pieces in a clean and minimal environment. This webcolumn&rsquo;s focus is currently one of liberal arts-type subjects, and the design of the front page is one that encourages finding pieces of interest to the visitor, rather than forcing the reader to scan through posts they may not enjoy.</p>
<p>To close, many of these thoughts on front page design stemmed from an article I read, <a href="http://jackcheng.com/the-slow-web">The Slow Web</a> by Jack Cheng. Although Cheng&rsquo;s focus was more on the companies who &ldquo;want us to spend every moment of our waking lives with them,&rdquo; the sentiments of what he wrote about are applicable to a news-based website as well.

      <h2>Front page design 2</h2>
      <p>Following my post on [The Front Page]({% post_url 2014-01-06-front-page %}), I had a good email conversation with my buddy, <a href="http://pxlnv.com">Nick Heer</a>. Our conversation brought up some more ideas regarding page design, and I wanted to expand on them here. Consider this post as part of an ongoing, public discussion and exploration of rhetorical design for the front page of a news and journalistic website.</p>
<h3 id="visitor-accessible-post-data">Visitor Accessible Post Data</h3>
<p>The following components can be found in nearly every text-based document (post, article, etc.) on the internet, and they should be considered mandatory data to make available to the reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>Permanent URI (often self-descriptive or in the address bar).</li>
<li>Publication date.</li>
<li>Title.</li>
<li>Full-text of the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything else (reading time, number of words, last updated date, and author name) is essentially unnecessary, albeit useful depending on what your communicative goals are.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Despite their necessity by nature, the four aforementioned pieces of information <em>do not</em> necessarily need to appear on the front page; as long as the reader has a way to access an individual post&rsquo;s URI — where all four pieces of data should be visible — there is some leniency in what information should appear on the front page.</p>
<h3 id="the-archives-as-a-front-page">The Archives as a Front Page</h3>
<p>If the plans are to update the front page frequently, which I&rsquo;m assuming they are, the sterile nature of an archive-as-front-page approach may not be ideal. A single, long list of article titles on the front page is nondescript by nature, and unless you are giving visual clues as to which items were previously visited, the task of navigating a sprawling list of text for new content can become difficult if the reader is unfamiliar with what headline they last read.</p>
<p>An attractive compromise might be to borrow some of the design from <a href="http://randsinrepose.com"><em>Rands in Repose</em></a> where the layout features a single article in full text, followed by a list of other posts (or, optionally, the whole archive). However, for news-based front pages, this type of design is dangerous. This format communicates that the latest post (with large font and primary screen placement) is the one a visitor should put all their attention into. But what if the latest post isn&rsquo;t interesting? You will have then set up a paradigm of forcing the focus on a single post without providing any alternative articles (of equal emphasis, and perceived importance) to a perplexed reader.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition, placing your archives underneath the full-text of a single post can create problems. Depending on how long your latest post is, the longer the newest article, the further down the page your archive will be pushed. This can be particularly bad if you&rsquo;ve removed any navigation links to a standalone Archives page; and if the front page doubles as an archives, why have redundant navigation?</p>
<h3 id="a-switch-back-to-liberal-design">A Switch Back to Liberal Design</h3>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not sold on the liberal 10-20 most-recent-posts for the the front page, this layout appears to be relatively safe in regards to handling reader expectations. In addition, listing several of the latest articles on the front page allows the reader to gauge a cumulative opinion of the type of writing the author is doing.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;ve switched to a layout that displays the five most recent articles in full-text, followed by a link to the Archives page at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Note: Although this decision reverses what I had initially decided to do, that is the inherit beauty of research; not all roads to discovery end with favorable results or conclusions.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on certain page metrics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate">bounce rate</a> and whether having the full-text of articles on the front page reduces the number of visitors to each post&rsquo;s URI. If you have comments or questions, feel free to <a href="/colophon">send me an email</a>.</p>

      <h2>Generating graphs with Processing</h2>
      <p><a href="http://designforfun.com/display.php?id=128">Ben Barry&rsquo;s post</a> on designing the 2011 Facebook f8 Conference remains one of my favorite pieces about design on the internet. As I was reading back through it the other day, I came across how Barry had gone about generating those signature Facebook graph images.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>While working on <a href="http://designforfun.com/display.php?id=99">f8 2010</a> we developed a rudimentary Processing script that allowed us to generate graph imagery. For 2011 we dusted it off and polished it up. With a some additional work we developed a robust tool that allowed us to rapidly iterate and develop graphics for a variety of applications. Because of the speed and flexibility it afforded us the entire graphic system for this years f8 was built using imagery generated with Processing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With nothing to do on my Saturday night, I downloaded <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a> and thought I&rsquo;d try to recreate Barry&rsquo;s technique.</p>
<p><img src="http://cargo.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/922.68256graph.png" alt="more graphs">
<img src="http://cargo.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/3835.7178graph.png" alt="more graphs">
<img src="http://cargo.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/3344.5784graph.png" alt="more graphs"></p>
<p>I ended up getting pretty close.</p>
<p>My script, which I ended up calling GraphMaker, starts by randomly placing nodes on the canvas. It then goes through every node and gets a list of nodes within a certain distance to that particular one. Then it&rsquo;s a simple matter of drawing lines from the original node to a limited number of close neighbors.</p>
<p>The results looked good, and I spent at least half an hour <strong>just</strong> tweaking all the parameters that go with each node (color, size, max distance a line can be between two nodes).</p>
<p>However, even though the graphs from my script look similar to the ones from f8, there&rsquo;s one significant flaw that I could never figure out how to fix: overlapping nodes.</p>
<p>Regardless how dense Barry&rsquo;s graphs, no node ever overlaps any of its neighbors - mine do. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but one that significantly impacted the quality of my images at the beginning. Eventually, I was able to compensate by having each node retain a slight transparency which enables you to still see individual nodes even when they overlap.</p>
<p>For now, my random-graph-making itch has been scratched, but I hope to revisit this one day and implement a check to ensure that each new node has a little space from its neighbor. Until then, feel free to check out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kyledreger/5519425">script on GitHub</a> and have some fun.</p>
<p>The final interesting thing from this experiment, that my girlfriend actually pointed out to me, is that each image resembles a constellation. Funny, yet oddly profound when taken in context with our own social graphs and the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A reader, Lalith P., sent me an email with <a href="https://github.com/cuttarug/graph-imagery">his solution</a> to the overlapping-nodes problem I was having. Thanks, Lalith!</p>

      <h2>Get FROGED</h2>
      <p>In college, trying to <em>fully rely on God every day</em> is hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our first real venture into the world and the need for us to be self-sufficient is overbearing. So much so, that we often forget to rely on Him to get us through. It&rsquo;s easy to forget to pray when we have homework, or substitute quiet time of reflection for hanging out with friends, but none of these things help us grow spiritually.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re surrounded by so much noise - from the TV, our friends and even ourselves can make it really hard to try and build a great relationship with God. I have to dig deep sometimes, but any time I&rsquo;ve invested in Him has been more than rewarding to me later on. Fully rely on Him every day, for all your needs. All your insecurities, all the doubts. Go to Him.</p>
<p>He asks something in return though. That you share this awesome comfort with others. How come we find it easier to say &ldquo;Do you want to go to Subway?&rdquo; than &ldquo;Do you want to go to church?&quot;. Be bold for Him and work towards spreading the love beyond yourself. Be bold.</p>

      <h2>GitHub&#39;s New Text Editor: Atom</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m in my text editor all day. So when a new player enters the field, I take notice and evaluate what it brings to the table over my current setup. Today, GitHub, the social code-sharing website, announced the arrival of <a href="http://atom.io">Atom.io</a> — a text editor they&rsquo;ve been building for <a href="https://twitter.com/defunkt/status/438791340222971904">around six years</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike my current editor (<a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>), Atom is billed as &ldquo;a desktop application based on web technologies,&rdquo; which means that the main interface is driven by a web-rendering engine, unlike most existing text editors today.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Considering that GitHub&rsquo;s main product excels at displaying code <em>in the browser</em>, it makes sense that Atom would continue running with that idea, bringing it to a native application.</p>
<p>Atom is also built to be highly extensible. If you want a feature added to the core, you can build it and submit your package to a centralized repository available to all Atom users. If you&rsquo;ve spent any time with Sublime Text&rsquo;s <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net">Package Control</a>, this concept will be familiar, and you&rsquo;ll be excited that Atom is shipping with a similar implementation.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Also interesting: Atom is being built with tight <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> integration. Node.js is still an area of unfamiliarity for me, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen, it looks to be 1.) really fast and 2.) have a thriving community supporting it. Two very good, important things for this type of software.</p>
<p>Atom is currently invite-only, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting my hands on it. Typically, most of the code I write ends up on GitHub, so seeing how they want a text editor to work is something I find exciting.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Adobe has been working on <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets.io</a>, which uses the same web-rendering approach, but Brackets appears to be geared more towards web developing and web designing. Atom, &ldquo;A hackable text editor for the 21st Century,&rdquo; appears to have slightly larger ambitions.</li>
<li>There are a number of similarities between Atom and Sublime Text that go beyond the Package Control / user-driven repository. The most striking is Atom&rsquo;s interface, which strongly resembles Sublime&rsquo;s. On one hand, there are only so many ways to lay out UI elements for a text editor; on the other, I originally thought &ldquo;Atom&rdquo; was just a new theme and color scheme for Sublime.</li>

      <h2>Giving up 30% to Sell In-App iOS Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>Peter Kafka, writing for <em>Re/code</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beats updated its iPhone app today, and now lets users subscribe to the $10 a month service from within the app, using iTunes&rsquo; billing system. That means Beats, and the music labels that license their stuff to the service, will give up $3 a month on every subscription sold through iTunes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beats Music is willing to take a 30% hit <em>just</em> to sell their same subscription, but through an in-app purchase dialog. Speaks volumes about the purchasing power of iOS users.</p>

      <h2>GoDaddy to File for IPO</h2>
      <p>Telis Demos and Mike Spector for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, reporting on the possibility of <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304914904579439542130264508-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwMDExNDAyWj">a GoDaddy IPO coming later</a> this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Scottsdale, Ariz., company, which provides domain-name registration and website-hosting services to more than 12 million customers world-wide, in the coming weeks plans to interview banks that would lead the underwriting of its IPO, the people said. Based on a typical IPO time frame, the company&rsquo;s shares could begin trading in the second half of the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a web designer and developer, one of the worst decisions you can make is to buy anything from GoDaddy. In my years of buying domains, hosting, and servers, GoDaddy remains the most terrible company I&rsquo;ve ever had to deal with. Each time a client tells me that they&rsquo;ve already bought a domain on GoDaddy, one of the first steps I recommend is to transfer that domain to a service that actually gives a dang — like <a href="http://hover.com">Hover</a>.</p>
<p>A deplorable user experience, a leadership that is more interested in using sex to sell their products than actually building good ones, and a never-ending barrage of opt-in services aimed at upselling you every step of the way. Stay away from this one.</p>

      <h2>Goodbye, Editorially</h2>
      <p>Editorially, the collaborative online writing application, is shutting down on May 30. From <a href="http://stet.editorially.com/articles/goodbye/">their Goodbye post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re proud of the team and tool that we built together and incredibly thankful that so many of you were willing to give it a try. And we continue to believe that evolving the way we collaborate as writers and editors is important work. But Editorially has failed to attract enough users to be sustainable, and we cannot honestly say we have reason to expect that to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We wish that were not the case — we’ve spent much of the past two years working on the hypothesis that the reverse was true — but today we must be honest with ourselves, and with you: this isn’t going to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Editorially got a lot of things right, and the tools they had built were something that I truly enjoyed using to collaborate with other editors and writers. Sad news.</p>

      <h2>Goodbye, Facebook</h2>
      <p>It started with one text from my girlfriend. The message read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>byebye facebook</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong words coming from her, but I got excited. Leaving Facebook was an idea I have been toying with for quite a while now, but never had the motivation to actually do. Here now was my opportunity, and I decided to take it it.</p>
<p>There were some real reasons for keeping my profile active, namely that I am the sole admin/developer for several pages and applications. However, after taking some time to transfer ownerships to other individuals (namely our office&rsquo;s &ldquo;social&rdquo; account so I can still do my job), I&rsquo;m free and clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what the effects of not owning a Facebook identity are. Facebook, having become a part of my generation&rsquo;s DNA and about to file for a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/technology/for-founders-to-decorators-facebook-riches.html">record-breaking IPO</a>, it will be weird to watch everything happen from the outside. However, it&rsquo;s about time I started removing some of the things that distract me from real life. Emily and I have a bet that the first one to log back in owes the other dinner, but after only <em>an hour</em> into this hiatus, I don&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;ll ever see a winner.</p>
<p>Sometime&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nice to be outside.</p>

      <h2>Google Buys Nest for $3.2 Billion</h2>
      <p>Google announced today that they had just <a href="http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html">paid $3.2 billion in cash</a> to acquire Nest, the makers of those [gorgeous thermostats]({% post_url 2013-10-08-the-nest-protect %}) and smoke detectors. This acquisition is interesting for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tony Fadell, Nest CEO and ex-Senior Vice President of the iPod Division at Apple, now works for Google.</li>
<li>Google now has a hand in the personal home safety game.</li>
</ol>
<p>My gut reaction is that Google is looking for new ways into the home, and buying Nest was a great way to open the door. If Nest could make thermostats look svelte and sexy, what other boring home appliances have they been wanting to reimagine, but couldn&rsquo;t afford to build? Given Nest&rsquo;s other products, my money&rsquo;s on them going after door locks, power outlets, or something in the kitchen.</p>

      <h2>Google death results</h2>
      <p>I was introspective this morning, and found myself Googling about death. I ran across <a href="http://xkcd.com/369/">this comic</a> by xkcd, got inspired and ended up collecting quite a bit of data about the number of search results Google gives back for any given age of death. I&rsquo;ve put those results into a graph for your pleasure, and you can also download the spreadsheet data in <a href="http://cargo.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-08-dreger-google-death-results.xls">.xls</a> if you like.</p>
<p><em><img src="/assets/images/google-death-results.png" alt="Graph image (.png) 115 KB"></em></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Download <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the image<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>All searches were done from a completely clean Google Chrome (v23.0.1271.95) instance on a Macbook Pro running OS X 10.8.2. Searches were done over Google&rsquo;s SSL.</p>
<p>I used the following query, substituting X for the numbers 10 through 110: <strong>&ldquo;dies at age X&rdquo; OR &ldquo;died at age X&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Then I copied Google&rsquo;s <em>estimated</em> number of possible results - the &ldquo;About 100,000 results (0.25 seconds)&rdquo; part - into a spreadsheet next to the value of X.</p>
<h3 id="notable-numbers">Notable numbers</h3>
<p>There were several notable spikes in the graph for a particular age. Whenever I would get one of these, I&rsquo;d scan the first few results and see if there was one major contributing player and put that name in a third column of my spreadsheet. For some ages (13, 45, and 37) there was a significant number of results, but no single individual I could credit.</p>
<p>The most significant ages were:</p>
<ul>
<li>17 (15,700,000 results) <em>Transplant patient Ollie Green</em></li>
<li>20 (14,100,000 results) <em>Director Bobby Farrelly&rsquo;s son</em></li>
<li>67 (6,910,000 results) <em>State Rep. Yvonne Kennedy</em></li>
<li>82 (5,600,000 results) <em>Astronaut Neil Armstrong</em></li>
<li>84 (3,620,000 results) <em>Singer Andy Williams</em></li>
<li>81 (3,530,000 results) <em>&ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; Star Larry Hagman</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, the ages that returned the least amount of results were:</p>
<ul>
<li>107 (44,600 results) <em>No one</em></li>
<li>104 (194,000 results) <em>Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer</em></li>
<li>108 (223,000 results) <em>Oldest survivor of Auschwitz</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an unconventional way to make a splash in Google&rsquo;s search results, I&rsquo;d recommend being somewhat famous and dying at age 107 or older.</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what put me in an introspective mood this morning, but I spent some time thinking about how short life really is. I thought about how we could go at any time, and that got me searching for various ages of death on Google.</p>
<p>I actually had to start the research over about halfway through my first attempt. The query I used initially left out the word &ldquo;age,&rdquo; which returned lots of items not related to human death. By including &ldquo;age&rdquo; I noticed the results were much more accurate for my goals. If anyone has a better query in mind, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

      <h2>Google Releases &#34;Web Designer&#34;</h2>
      <p>It would be much more honest if they called it Google <em>Ad</em> Designer. Google needed a way to help designers make HTML5-based advertisements, and <a href="http://www.google.com/webdesigner/">this is their solution</a>.</p>
<p>I understand wanting to help create good web ads, but I&rsquo;m curious why Web Designer doesn&rsquo;t look like any of the company&rsquo;s other applications. Most of Google&rsquo;s recent designs have shared a consistent language, <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016268/google-the-redesign">as noted by</a> Farhad Manjoo of <em>Fast Company</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White space. Cards. Clean typography. And a simple, consistent interface to access Google&rsquo;s boundless power. These are the most recognizable elements in Google&rsquo;s new library of design elements&ndash;the main phrases in what the company calls its common design language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>White space? Clean typography? Just <a href="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/google-web-designer.png">look at it</a>. There&rsquo;s no acknowledgment of these principles. I personally think it looks ugly, but then so do most web advertisements out there.</p>

      <h2>Google&#39;s Hangouts App Can Now Make Phone Calls</h2>
      <p>Google recently updated their Hangouts app on iOS to include the ability to make phone calls within the U.S. and Canada for free. However, the most interesting new feature is you can now make <em>and receive</em> calls in Hangouts if you have a <a href="https://www.google.com/voice">Google Voice number</a>. This should provide much-needed relief for anyone who&rsquo;s had to use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-voice/id318698524">the abysmal &ldquo;Google Voice&rdquo; app</a> to manage their Google-given number.</p>
<p>The update to Hangouts also offers a peek into Google&rsquo;s long-term strategy for iOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to offer and create better web services than Apple.</li>
<li>Make those services available in well-designed iOS apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a strategy of direct attack, rather one that allows Google to continue feeding their services to iOS, hoping to lower the barrier of entry to Android later down the road.</p>

      <h2>GORUCK GR1</h2>
      <p><em><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2950/15296464710_49e862e378_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been a year and a half since I first received my <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/GR1">GORUCK GR1</a> rucksack. Unlike an app or new piece of technology, a bag like this needs <em>months</em> of thorough use before a true opinion can be formed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t want this being called a review of the GR1 — I have yet to take this bag to the limits of its advertised durability and strength. That being said, this bag has suffered through the type of lifestyle my gear has to put up with — one that includes: muddy soccer boots and sweaty gear; trudging through rain and snow; and being tossed into trunks, onto car floors and skidded across asphalt. The GR1, crafted out of <a href="http://www.cordura.com/en/about/faq.html">1000 Denier Cordura</a>, has matched everything I could throw at it, and I look forward to using it for the next 20 years.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you want to hear the GORUCK story and how they got started, go read <a href="http://news.goruck.com/challenge/goruck-origins/">their &ldquo;origins letter&rdquo;</a>, written by GORUCK&rsquo;s founder, Jason McCarthy.</em></p>

<h3 id="a-namezippersa-zippers-and-pulls"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Zippers and pulls</h3>
<p><em><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3935/15296274489_daf0f7d9d2_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>Zippers, for me, are the primary &ldquo;user experience&rdquo; of a bag. If the zippers suck, you will be putting yourself through a painful experience hundreds of times a week. Thankfully, GORUCK uses <a href="http://www.ykk-usa.com">YKK brand zippers</a>, which are considered some of the best in the world. These zippers have not failed me once, and they provide a very satisfying sound when zipping / unzipping.</p>
<p>However, as the great as the zippers are, the weakest part of the GR1 is the zipper pulls. These small, shrink-plastic tubes help provide some tactile grip to the strings around each zipper. After about six months, I began to notice that my pulls were beginning to expand at each end, tearing ever so slightly. The string was still fine, but I knew I would eventually want to replace the tubing. Originally, I tried sending an email to Jon Gaffney at <em>Gear Patrol</em> who wrote about this phenomenon for his <a href="http://gearpatrol.com/2012/05/14/kit-one-year-with-the-goruck-gr1/">One Year with the GORUCK GR1</a>, but after several attempted emails, I never got a response.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15460070636_1cf5f5066d_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thankfully, the GR1 comes with the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/scars">GORUCK Scars warranty</a>, which is a lifetime warranty that covers any damage that is &ldquo;earned under our standards of abuse, which are excessive.&rdquo; I sent a single email to the Scars team, and they mailed me a handful of extra pull ties, free-of-charge.</p>
<h3 id="a-namestrapsa-straps"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Straps</h3>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how well-crafted a bag is, if the straps aren&rsquo;t able to position the load correctly, you&rsquo;ll be unnecessarily, and physically, strained.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15296463150_332255a578_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>To that end, I feel the folks at GORUCK put most of their time into designing and iterating on the straps that ship with the GR1. Although the straps took a week to break in, weight from the bag now feels evenly distributed across my chest and shoulders. I can pack the GR1 full with books, clothes, and my laptop, and it still feels comfortable to carry around.</p>
<h3 id="a-namelaptopa-laptop-compartment"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Laptop compartment</h3>
<p><em><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3949/15483173195_0276b96f7e_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the primary reasons I decided to go with the GR1 is because of its laptop compartment. Padded and easily accessible, the &ldquo;bombproof&rdquo; laptop compartment is both efficient and extremely protective.</p>
<p>The laptop compartment is large enough to fit the 17-inch Macbook Pro, but what about smaller laptops? I tested the laptop compartment with a 13-inch Macbook Air and a 15-inch Macbook Pro Retina. Both were secured very snuggly.</p>
<p>A small anecdote about the protection of the GR1&rsquo;s laptop compartment. Last year, as I was foolishly steering my bike with one hand, I turned too quickly and was thrown over my handlebars. I hit the concrete and rolled three times before stopping. Once I recovered from the shock of flying a good 15 feet, I checked my bag. Aside from a few external scuffs, everything <em>inside</em> the GR1 was completely fine, including my Macbook.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re on the topic of laptops, I&rsquo;ll take another moment to vouch for the GR1&rsquo;s <em>near</em> waterproofness. Although GORUCK states that none of their bags are completely waterproof, I have walked through torrential downpours with no umbrella, and my laptop and gear have remained completely dry.</p>
<h3 id="a-namefita-fit"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Fit</h3>
<p><em><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5604/15296582868_c9c4110d01_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>One of the questions I get asked most frequently is in regards to how the GR1 fits. For reference, I&rsquo;m about 5-foot-9 and around 150 lb. Personally, I find the GR1 is a near-perfect size — particularly with the straps about halfway loosened. Officially, GORUCK recommends the GR1 for anyone 6-foot and over; however, I would lower the recommended height down to around 5-8 and 5-9. If you are any shorter, the <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/gr0">GORUCK GR0</a> (a smaller version of the GR1) will suit you nicely.</p>
<p>If you are on the fence between a GR0 and GR1, and are around 5-8 tall, I would spend the extra $20 and go with the GR1. On countless occasions, I have found the extra space useful, whether for jackets, water bottles, or shoes.</p>
<h3 id="a-namemollea-molle-webbing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> MOLLE webbing</h3>
<p><em><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15480032781_79d838655e_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>MOLLE (Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) webbing is found on the front, both sides, and across the inside-top of the GR1. In theory, you are able to attach <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/gr1-field-pocket">extra pockets</a> or gear to these straps; however, I haven&rsquo;t found much use for mine — outside of clipping on my keys with a carabiner.</p>
<p>The MOLLE webbing does add an undeniable style to the GR1. Although GORUCK tries to make all their products feel more-civilian-less-military, having a bag with MOLLE webbing everywhere is going to make blending a little more difficult. I like the added webbing - it adds a uniqueness that I feel is missed in the <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/sk26">GORUCK SK26</a>, but if you are someone who does a lot of international traveling, you may want to consider whether a military-focused design is something you want.</p>
<h3 id="a-namepocketsa-pockets"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Pockets</h3>
<p>If you are the type of person who needs lots of tiny pockets to organize your gear, the GR1 might seem unappealing at first glance. One of the things that first drew me to the GORUCK brand is the minimalistic style they apply to their gear. Other than the laptop compartment, the GR1 has a single pocket on its exterior.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3932/15480030201_bd93e6f933_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>Although deep, this front pocket will not hold anything too thick, and I use it primarily as a place to store my Field Notes notebooks, wallet, and keys.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5603/15480031231_9b9e1c1a13_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>Inside the bag, the GR1 gives you three different areas to store your gear. Two of these pockets reside on the inside of the main flap: one small pocket (good for pens, notebooks, and keys), and one large pocket, which uses mesh instead of Cordura (good for cords and small items).</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15482818092_12239f3850_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>Against the back wall of the GR1 is a single pocket, which is made out of Cordura and secured with an elastic strap. This pocket is great for putting things you want to give a little extra protection.</p>
<h3 id="a-namewashinga-washing"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Washing</h3>
<p>This is something unique to GORUCK that I&rsquo;ve not found with other bags: you can (and are encouraged to) wash them. I&rsquo;m not a messy or dirty person by nature, but anything that spends a majority of its life on my person will start to accumulate some dirt. This is particularly true of the main compartment, if you (like me) are constantly moving loose papers, paperclips, and notes in and out.</p>
<p>Aside from taking a wet cloth and wiping down the exterior, GORUCK has <a href="http://news.goruck.com/gear-explained/cleaning-goruck-rucksacks-explained/">a great post</a> on how they clean their bags. 15 minutes, a brush, and lots of water leaves my GR1 looking near brand new.</p>
<h3 id="a-namepatchesa-patches"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Patches</h3>
<p><em><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3942/15480029891_897b6381e1_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, the GR1 has a subtle military design, reinforced by the MOLLE webbing. However, the one place where you can add a little bit of color (or not) to the GR1 is on the front velcro patch.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3956/15480029531_7ac0434e40_o_d.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to put anything there, but I chose to use GORUCK&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/embroidered-reverse-flag-patch-reflective">embroidered, reflective reverse flag patch</a>. Having something a little reflective helps when I&rsquo;m biking around campus at night. Plus, the silver lining of the reflective flag adds a nice accent to the overall aesthetic.</p>
<p>Side note: if you are curious (as I was) as to why GORUCK&rsquo;s flags are reverse, <a href="http://news.goruck.com/gear-explained/gorucks-reverse-flag-explained/">this post</a> on the GORUCK blog explained it nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reverse flag dates back to the Army’s early history when both cavalry and infantry units would charge ahead as the Stars and Stripes streamed back. When moving forward, therefore, the star field is always to the front as the red and white stripes flow to the back in the breeze. Today, the reverse flag is worn on the right sleeve of military uniforms and symbolizes the courage and respect of those who serve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes sense, but be ready to explain it to those who have confused looks on their faces.</p>
<h3 id="a-nameconclusiona-conclusion"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Conclusion</h3>
<p>For almost two years, I have used my GORUCK GR1 every single day. It has been put through rain, snow, mud, sweat, collision, and all the day-to-day hazards a college student-athlete may find themselves experiencing. It has served me extremely well. The Scars warranty is a life-long deal for the GR1, so I can always send it back to GORUCK if need be.</p>
<p><em><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3943/15483174625_7f65e3d0dc_o.jpg" alt="gr1"></em></p>
<p>Although the $295 price tag may seem too high for <em>just</em> a bag, this is the type of bag that will literally last the rest of your <em>life</em>. For me, I would rather spend a little extra money up front for the GR1, and spend the next 25 years breaking it in, then spend $50 every two years for something that I can&rsquo;t fully rely on.</p>

      <h2>Grocery Shopping from Home</h2>
      <p>Amazon Dash is a new device that lets you scan the barcode on household items and have them added to your online Amazon.com or AmazonFresh shopping cart. The idea is that, as you are running low, you scan your cereal, milk, and paper towels — all of which will then be shipped to your door in a few days.</p>
<p>Amazon Dash is currently only available by &ldquo;invitation only,&rdquo; and it is unclear if it requires an AmazonFresh account, which is only open to residents of Seattle, San Francisco, or Southern California.

      <p><em>Update: this post was written over on a Wordpress blog I had during the summer. Although I migrated most of the posts to my current setup, some are written with the implication that they&rsquo;re still over there - silly things.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to warn you, this will probably be a little rough for the first couple weeks. I typically write longer, thought-out posts over on <a href="http://kyledreger.com/">kyledreger.com</a>, and never felt that short entries should fill the archives. Here, however, the game&rsquo;s changed. I want to get better at writing on a smaller scale, not just when I have 1,500 words in <a href="http://iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a habit. Habits are built day by day, week by week, and more often than not, they don&rsquo;t stick. Consistency is one of the only ways to ensure a habit has time to take root in your life and grow. I can tell some days are going to be like pulling teeth to get up and write, but I need to. If I do, I&rsquo;ll eventually become a better writer and it won&rsquo;t be as difficult.</p>

      <h2>Hemingway: Write Bold and Clear</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a>, developed by Adam and Ben Long, is a small website where you can have your text analyzed against a variety of clarity-focused metrics. From the home page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemingway highlights long, complex sentences and common errors; if you see a yellow highlight, shorten the sentence or split it. If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic — try editing this sentence to remove the red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the syntax parser could use some tweaking (and Markdown support for that matter), I personally liked Hemingway&rsquo;s presentation of &ldquo;sentence syntax&rdquo; over that of [Information Architect&rsquo;s Writer Pro]({% post_url 2013-12-19-writer-pro-for-mac %}).</p>
<p>Hemingway, as the name implies, tries to enforce a very bold and clear writing style, emblematic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>. I personally enjoy this style of writing; however, as new syntax- and grammar-focused tools start to appear, it is important to remember that there are no true <em>hard</em> rules of grammar. You can break any of these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; you want, just be sure to do so with purpose.</p>

      <h2>Hoodies</h2>
      <p>I love them. Hooded sweatshirts, or &ldquo;hoodies&rdquo;, are one of my favorite pieces of clothing. Whenever I get a hoodie, I&rsquo;ll wear it until the fabric is begging to be thrown away. I love the simple colors and pulling the sleeves up when you sit down to type. I enjoy trying to make the drawstrings perfectly symmetrical. Eventually, however, I almost always end up pulling that string out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re versatile, able to be worn through the winter and on cool summer nights. They work well at bedtime, and I often sleep in one when it&rsquo;s cooler. In the morning, putting on a hoodie to drink your tea outside in the sunshine is a great feeling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost certain hoodies were made for runners. Especially during the fall, lacing up a trusty pair of tennis shoes, pulling a hoodie over your head and taking to the road is blissful.</p>
<p>Zip-up, pull-over, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ve always found a sense of comfort when I pull a freshly cleaned hooded sweatshirt out of the dryer. They&rsquo;ll be something I&rsquo;ll always own.</p>

<p>David Pierce, writing for <em>The Verge</em>, has a lot <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5544642/htc-one-review-m8">of really good things to say</a> about HTC&rsquo;s newest model, and it seems that this iteration fixes most of the issues that users bemoaned about in the previous design. Sadly, however, the One&rsquo;s camera still stinks compared to the competition, and HTC continues to plaster their &ldquo;Sense&rdquo; UI over Android, which often makes things look worse instead of better.</p>
<p>The HTC &ldquo;One&rdquo; devices remain the only Android phones I&rsquo;d ever consider buying. Camera and Sense UI aside, the excellent battery and performance make this an attractive phone for any Android fans out there.</p>

      <h2>I Don&#39;t Need a Popcorn Button</h2>
      <p>Aaron Shekey, a designer and developer living in Minneapolis, recently remodeled his kitchen, which gave him the opportunity to <a href="http://www.aaronshekey.com/posts/the-hot-dog-button/">take a look at the current state of design amid various home appliances</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my frustration I discovered that all I wanted from a microwave was a single knob. That’s it. I want to open a carefully considered door, close it without waking the neighbors, twist a single knob to the desired time, press it to start, and hear a single chime when it’s done. Press again to cancel, or simply twist counter-clockwise to zero it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the crux of Shekey&rsquo;s argument: that most household appliances have let <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature creep</a> go too far. However, I am not sure his solution of a single-knob microwave is the right answer. Perhaps answering &ldquo;why did buttons become popular in the first place?&rdquo; would be a better place to start.</p>
<p>Just from personal observation, I notice that older folks might find buttons easier to actuate, with greater accuracy, than twisting a knob. For them, buttons have a very important <em>practical</em> purpose. That being said, Shekey&rsquo;s definitely on the right track, and I hope to see a follow-up post that further explores this area of design.</p>

      <h2>I lost my iPhone</h2>
      <p>Fun little thing that happened to me today:</p>
<p>Was walking in the library when I went to grab my iPhone, but it wasn&rsquo;t in my pocket. I checked my bag and laptop case, but it wasn&rsquo;t there either. I started to freak out a bit. I didn&rsquo;t have a passcode set and thinking of how many websites it was authenticated with made me sweat.</p>
<p>I quickly went to a computer, logged on to iCloud.com and went to Find My iPhone. I saw a little GPS pin drop on the east side of the library and start moving towards the circulation desk. After marveling at this realtime event, I remotely set the passcode and had it show the message &ldquo;Please call:&rdquo; with my girlfriend&rsquo;s cell phone number. Five minutes later the circulation desk calls her. They have my phone and we walk over to pick it up.</p>
<p>Apple rocks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you came here to read about ground-breaking new features, we have to apologize: iA Writer has not become bigger. It has become lighter, smarter, more refined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a great way to phrase <a href="https://ia.net/writer/updates/ia-writer-3">the changes in this update</a>. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see an app remove features, while still moving towards their original goal: a minimalistic writing experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also happy to see that there is, once again, a single version iA Writer, rather than the Regular / Pro variants they had before. Personally, I found having two versions annoying. Only want to write, iA Writer; have night mode and other editing features, iA Writer Pro. Back and forth. Ick.</p>
<p>Writer 3.0 is an excellent merger of Pro features into the Regular interface, and the new swipe gestures are really nice once you&rsquo;re used to them. Well done!</p>
<p>Also, love the new icon. Emblematic of 3.0 in many ways.</p>

      <h2>iMessage Woes Continue</h2>
      <p>Over at <em>Re/code</em>, Ina Fried sheds some more light on [that nasty bug in iMessage]({% post_url 2014-05-13-imessage %}):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>iMessage relies on Apple’s messaging system to intercept a text message sent to another iOS device and re-routes it through its servers rather than sending it via the wireless carriers as a standard SMS or MMS message.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The benefits of iMessage include bypassing a wireless carrier’s text messaging charges, enabling the ability to tell when a message is read or delivered and to send a message simultaneously to all of one’s iOS and Mac devices. However, Apple’s system has proved problematic in that in order to work properly, it needs to have an accurate knowledge of which phone numbers are actually associated with iPhones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An intermittent fix appears to be turning off iMessage across all your devices, <em>before</em> switching to a non-iOS device:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] users can avoid problems if they turn off iMessage on their iPhone and uncheck the phone numbers from any other Apple devices on which they are using iMessage before switching to a new non-Apple device. However, this requires some planning and still may not a guarantee a smooth transition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if you don&rsquo;t turn off iMessage before leaving iOS, any other iOS devices (that you have sent iMessages to in the past) will continue to send messages to you via iMessages, not SMS. Because iMessage is exclusive to iOS, iMessage-bound messages to non-iOS devices will never reach their recipient.</p>

      <h2>InstantClick.js</h2>
      <p>Incredibly smart JavaScript library from <a href="https://github.com/dieulot">Alex Dieulot</a> that uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history">HTML5 pushState() spec</a> to pre-load whichever link a user is currently hovering over. From the <a href="http://instantclick.io">InstantClick homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latency is inevitable with today’s internet architecture so InstantClick cheats by preloading links you are likely to click on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before a visitor clicks on a link, he hovers over that link. Between these two events, 200 ms to 300 ms usually pass by (<a href="http://instantclick.io/click-test.html">test yourself here</a>). InstantClick makes use of that time to preload the page, so that the page is already there when you click.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dieulot references the Nielsen Norman Group&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/">3 Important Limits</a> article, which lists the optimal response times for human-computer interaction. From the study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A delay of 0.2–1.0 seconds does mean that users notice the delay and thus feel the computer is &ldquo;working&rdquo; on the command, as opposed to having the command be a direct effect of the users&rsquo; actions. Example: If sorting a table according to the selected column can&rsquo;t be done in 0.1 seconds, it certainly has to be done in 1 second, or users will feel that the UI is sluggish and will lose the sense of &ldquo;flow&rdquo; in performing their task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note: If you care about usability, the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/">whole article</a> is a really great read.</em></p>
<p>Ideas like InstantClick are not new, Ruby on Rails has <a href="https://github.com/rails/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> that accomplishes the same goal, but I have yet to see an implementation that is so simple to install for non-Rails projects. Include two lines of code (one of which calls the minified script), and you&rsquo;ll be off and running.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, then the script should be running on my site now, albeit for desktop browsers only (Dieulot has mobile support via touchDown coming soon). To test it out, feel free to click through some of the articles in <a href="/archives">the archives</a> or any of the stories on the front page; you should notice that pages seem to load near instantly.</p>
<p>Even though static sites are fast by nature, I have been really impressed with the increase in speed that InstantClick has afforded me. I look forward to watching it develop.</p>

      <h2>Interview: Loren Brichter</h2>
      <p>After [noticing that Letterpress had been sold to Solebon LLC][me], I reached out to Atebit&rsquo;s founder and sole proprietor, Loren Brichter. After we waited a few weeks to let things settle down, Mr. Brichter agreed to do a small interview over email. What follows is our conversation about selling Letterpress, iOS, and developing on the web.</p>
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>K.Q. Dreger:</strong> Hello, Loren. Thanks for agreeing to do this interview. I&rsquo;ll cut right to the chase: Why decide to sell  Letterpress? From [my correspondence with Solebon][me], I know that they originally approached you in early 2015, but you weren&rsquo;t interested. What changed from 2Q to 4Q?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Brichter:</strong> For the last few years(!?) I’ve been trying to find some time to invest in the game, but other projects kept getting in the way, I ultimately realized that it would be a long time before I could get around to doing all the things I wanted to do, and these folks had the time and motivation to work on it right now. Just seemed like the game deserved some love, and I couldn’t give it.</p>
<h2 id="gamecenter--20">Gamecenter + 2.0</h2>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Solebon recently released version 2.0 of Letterpress, their first major update since the acquisition. Two of the headlining features are a new user account system, as opposed to Game Center, and a new &ldquo;secured&rdquo; copy of Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s dictionary, which they&rsquo;ll use as the database for playable words.</p>
<p>Both of these changes are in stark contrast to your original approach: matchmaking and user accounts were managed entirely by Game Center, and <a href="https://github.com/Atebits/Words">the entire Letterpress dictionary</a> was available to the public on GitHub. Were these changes something you advised, or were they already in Solbon&rsquo;s roadmap for  Letterpress?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Brichter:</strong> I had actually looked into licensing an official dictionary. Maintaining a word list is tough, loads of gray areas, impossible to make everyone happy, so I understand why they did it. (Super super happy they re-added the ability to play bad words though, I would have been fucking bummed otherwise).</p>
<p>Switching off Game Center was priority #1 for me, and when they said they could build a new backend for the game it pretty much sealed the deal. Game Center was rough. It was my mistake to use it. The game had always been cross-platform (Mac+iOS), but there were so many bugs in Game Center for Mac that if I had launched it I would have been crushed under the weight of tech support.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> In the past, you&rsquo;ve not been shy about <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenb/status/737678840135311360">poking fun</a> at Game Center. Indeed, even though  Letterpress launched to critical acclaim, I think a good number of early players ran into the infamous <a href="http://www.Atebits.com/support/faq/gamecenter-sillyerror/"><code>SILLY ERROR -1001, 23</code></a>. <a href="http://kotaku.com/5955318/apples-game-center-seems-to-be-malfunctioning-today-blame-letterpress">Many</a> <a href="http://www.imore.com/no-skin-game-center">speculated</a> that it was  Letterpress&rsquo;s popularity that was highlighting the limitations of Game Center.</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> Yep. Nobody could play the game for a while after it launched. If I cared to track attrition rates I’m sure I would have crawled into a hole.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/02/apple-service-outages/#XjQHPAf3RaqM">Last week&rsquo;s service outage</a> notwithstanding, if you were developing  Letterpress today, would Game Center still be a part of your original stack?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1VCcECJ.gifv">Nope</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Shareable replays were one of my favorite parts of playing  Letterpress. Reliving victories and analyzing defeats became a core part of my, and I&rsquo;m sure other&rsquo;s, strategy. Shortly after launching sharable replays in 2012, Macstories&rsquo; Federico Viticci <a href="https://www.macstories.net/links/letterpress-1-2-brings-html5-replay-feature/">interviewed you about the feature</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I [Viticci] also wanted to ask Brichter about the technological component of Replay; he told me that, with this technology in place, he could now consider other neat visualizations for Letterpress games: for instance, he mentioned charts for scores and word lengths as possible implementations of the Replay webpage, which simply requires server-side updates. Brichter is also thinking about documenting the data format to allow other developers to build analysis tools for Letterpress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We never saw some of these ideas come to light, but did any of them make it into any sort of development?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> Hadn’t gotten that far, sadly!</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> How do you feel about the design direction of iOS, now that the flat, simplified aesthetic of iOS 7 has had a couple of years to mature?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> I’m surprised it hasn’t changed much. And every iPhone user I know over 40 has all those visual accessibility features (button shapes, etc) turned on, and those are an ocular abomination (and shouldn’t be necessary at all).</p>
<p>Now, if some of the Apple TV aesthetic makes it back to iOS, whoooomama, then we’d be talking.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Even though the aesthetic of Letterpress was a precursor to what we would see with iOS 7, one of the big differences was your use of shadows and animation to help illustrate depth. Looking at it today, Letterpress seems to share more in common with Google&rsquo;s Material Design than it does with iOS. Would you agree with that?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> Absolutely! When Google announced Material Design I was very excited that somebody was attempting to formalize a wholistic approach to modern software design. It wasn’t precisely what I would have done, but definitely had a familiar vibe ;). Overall I thought it was a fantastic step in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> In a 2012 interview with Gigaom, Erica Ogg wrote about how you &ldquo;built his own version of the user interface framework,&rdquo; when designing the graphics for  Letterpress. Today, that sounds a lot like Metal, the low-level hardware-accelerated graphics API that debuted with iOS 8. Had Metal been around back when you were developing  Letterpress, would that have changed how you approached developing the UI?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> Probably not. Metal is awesome (ditto for Vulkan), but draw calls were never my bottleneck. Plus I tend to err on the side of using things that aren’t blatantly proprietary, GL was good enough, despite the huge warts.</p>
<h2 id="atebits">Atebits</h2>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> This is going to sound a bit odd, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ask: you tend to use a lot of &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; on the <a href="http://www.Atebits.com/contact/">Atebits</a> site. Are you still the sole employee at Atebits?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> Mostly just me, there were a few periods where I’d have people help with tech support and whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> I love your use of Museo Sans Rounded on Atebits.com and in  Letterpress itself. Any particular reason you went with Museo Sans over another family that offers a rounded variant, like Proxima Nova, Gotham, or FF Din?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> Just liked it. Seemed friendly and casual.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> You&rsquo;ve mentioned in past interviews that  Letterpress was &ldquo;a testbed for more stuff.&rdquo; Any chance I can get a hint at what that stuff might be? Can I assume that it&rsquo;s going to be iOS related, or do you see yourself playing more with web-based products (considering your experience building shareable replays)?</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> I haven’t launched Xcode (on purpose) in a long time. My work for the last few years has been on the web, and honestly, it’s a breath of fresh air. Instant refreshing, surprisingly good debugging / perf tools, intrinsically multi-platform, and most importantly, open.</p>
<p>Web tech gets a lot of shit from native devs (some of it deserved). But the alternatives are worse. I find the entire concept of App Review morally questionable despite Apple’s good intentions. So I sleep better at night not being part of that anymore. Sure, the web is messy, and it’s delicate, but it’s important and good and getting better fast.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t be surprised if I never went back.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Are there any games you&rsquo;re playing now that you really enjoy? iOS or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> I started playing <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes</a> again. It’s still amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Current iPhone model? (I have my money on iPhone SE)</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> I clung to my iPhone 5 for as long as I could, but some iOS update made it unusable (if you accidentally touched an iMessage notification the whole UI would lock up for a minute or two), so I succumbed and got a 6S. Definitely going back to the 4” form factor the next chance I get.</p>
<p><strong>Dreger:</strong> Last one, and it&rsquo;s a surprise question: will I ever get to see an <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/general/scribbles-simple-intuitive-drawing-for-mac/">update to Scribbles</a>? (Yes, I still have a copy, and yes it&rsquo;s still excellent.)</p>
<p><strong>Brichter:</strong> I’d love to do it! But it will definitely be a web app.</p>

      <h2>Interviewing as research</h2>
      <p>For my English class, we are working on writing a profile based on an interview we have conducted with an individual. This is a new form of investigation for me, I&rsquo;m use to doing my own static research on a subject, curating the good from the bad and then polishing the result into something someone would maybe want to read. It&rsquo;s been the same process since high school.</p>
<p>With writing a profile, it&rsquo;s different. The person you&rsquo;re interviewing is a living, dynamic individual. Even if you go into an interview with thirty of the best, most relevant questions to ask your subject, you are almost guaranteed to never get to all of them and to be sidetracked down a different avenue of their life before you&rsquo;re through. This is one of the most addicting parts of doing this form of research; the type of the information you find depends entirely on where you, and the subject, steer the conversation.</p>
<p>As I sit in my chair with my iPhone&rsquo;s microphone recording the interview, I&rsquo;m quickly switching gears between asking questions and scratching down notes next to the time of the interview they&rsquo;re relevant to. Later, when I go through the arduous task of transcribing a 30 minute audio file, it&rsquo;s like going back into a time machine. I get to fly back through the timeline of our conversation and pick out that one specific thing they said about their home life, or that experience they had in college; all perfectly recounted in their own words.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that the whole process takes a substantial amount of time, researching by means of interviewing individuals has to be my new favorite way to gather information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s addicting.</p>

      <h2>iOS 7.0.3 Released with Faster Transitions</h2>
      <p>Quietly shipped alongside all that was released on Tuesday, iOS 7.0.3 is now available for download.</p>
<p>In addition to iCloud Keychain, which lets you sync your passwords between iOS devices, Apple has also addressed complaints regarding the system-wide parallax effects. Federico Viticci for <em>MacStories</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple has listened, and in iOS 7.0.3 the Reduce Motion setting (available in General &gt; Accessibility) now truly reduces animations: switching to apps and back to Home screen, unlocking the device, and moving between folders is now a cross-fade that is much faster than Apple’s animations with Reduce Motion turned off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank goodness. Although I really liked iOS 7, those transitions were time consuming and felt unnecessary. The cross-fade effect could be quicker still, but it&rsquo;s a huge improvement from before.</p>

      <h2>Jeff Bezos will Pay You $5k to Quit Working at Amazon</h2>
      <p>Jeff Bezos, in his annual letter to shareholders of Amazon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The program] is called Pay to Quit. It was invented by the clever people at Zappos, and the Amazon fulfillment centers have been iterating on it. Pay to Quit is pretty simple. Once a year, we offer to pay our associates to quit. The first year the offer is made, it’s for $2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year until it reaches $5,000. The headline on the offer is “Please Don’t Take This Offer.” We hope they don’t take the offer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don’t want to be isn’t healthy for the employee or the company.</p>

      <h2>Kerbal Space Program</h2>
      <p><em>By guest editor, Christopher B. Durr.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard —John F. Kennedy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This famous quote by Jack is one of my favorites and one that I think we often forget to remember. President Kennedy, of course, was talking about what would become the U.S. space program. A program that involved strapping human beings to giant stacks of fuel and launching them 230,000+ miles away from home, in a time when computers were the size of rooms. Hard – I might have picked a different word.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve always admired the scientists and engineers that worked, and still <em>do</em> work, to put humans into space. Yet, my admiration was always from a distance. I thought their job impossible, but in the way you might think a theoretical physicist&rsquo;s, or a cardiovascular surgeon’s job is impossible.</p>
<p>However, recently I discovered something that made the intangible tangible: a game called <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a>. We don&rsquo;t ordinarily do video game reviews on AF, but Kerbal Space Program is far from ordinary.</p>
<hr>
<p>The premise of the game revolves around the Kerbals, a race of little green people who have decided they&rsquo;d like to embark from their home planet (Kerbin, an Earth-like body) into space. You, the player, are in charge of building their space program. You design the rockets, the lander, the satellites — all of it. And you&rsquo;re up against all of the physics and mathematics that go with actual space exploration. [1] In the mode I’ve been playing, all your resources are free, but you unlock better parts by collecting &ldquo;science.&rdquo; [2] You start off with just enough parts to get you off the ground and from there, save for a few brief tutorials, you are on your own.</p>
<p>I put some thought into my first flight. I made sure to have the right thrust to weight ratio. I checked to make sure my re-entry pod was able to decouple from the fuel. I even added some winglets for added aerodynamic stabilization. [3] Then, in a blaze of glory, I launched my first Kerbin into the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>My Kerbonaut looked at me triumphantly.</p>
<p>He looked proud.</p>
<p>He looked happy.</p>
<p>He looked for where I had placed the parachute release switch.</p>
<p>He looked a bit pissed when he realized I&rsquo;d forgotten that small detail.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t watch the end result.</p>
<p>This was not the first (nor, unfortunately, the last) Kerbal that I&rsquo;ve sacrificed for the sake of fictional science. As that poor pioneer was hurtling back towards earth at 9.8 m/s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I honestly felt bad about it, and it’s been a long time since a game made me <em>feel</em> something like that. The forgotten parachute was my oversight, my mistake, and I had to own that in this game.</p>
<hr>
<p>This feeling of ownership only grows as your space program evolves. Eventually, I learned how to escape the atmosphere. I learned how to orbit. I <em>thought</em> I learned how to fly around outside my orbiting ship. I <em>know</em> there is a Kerbal in geosynchronous orbit somewhere over Kerbin right now, forever out of the reach of his spaceship. [4]</p>
<p>So far, the crowning jewel of my tiny space program has been successfully flying to Kerbin&rsquo;s closest moon, the Mün. [5] I flew the third iteration of my fourth generation space craft. I finally hit all of my orbital burns. My periapsis was perfect. [6] I was on my way to the Mün after hours of failures and dozens of lost Kerbonaut lives. After a few precarious rocket burns, I drifted into a stable orbit. Halfway there, with almost no fuel left, I took some observations and contemplated my way back to Kerbin. I knew that if I didn&rsquo;t correctly calculate the return trip, I&rsquo;d strand my Kerbal in space forever. I literally held my breath until I was on a course for home. I cringed as I watched the pod re-enter the atmosphere at 400 m/s, and my heart was racing as it gently splashed down in the ocean.</p>
<p>I had done it.</p>
<p>I had reached the Mün in a spacecraft I had designed, launched and flown. And it was <em>not</em> easy. Actually, it was exceedingly hard. Today&rsquo;s video games can be hard, but they&rsquo;re hard because you don&rsquo;t have the same reflexes as someone else or you have to go collect 20,000 of something. This game was hard because it took planning, skill and discovery. Kerbal Space Program will leave you frustrated and fed up, but it will also leave you with something a video game can rarely offer: genuine satisfaction.</p>
<p>Kerbal Space Program is a great game and you should choose to play it; not because it is easy, but because it is hard.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>I hope you remember your calculous.</li>
<li>I wish it were that easy in real life.</li>
<li>Because, you know, science.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry. He’s in a stable orbit and apparently Kerbals don&rsquo;t need to eat, drink or breathe. One day when I get better I&rsquo;ll send a rescue mission. I’ve heard he&rsquo;s enjoying the view.</li>
<li>Yes, umlaut included. <em>Editor&rsquo;s note: Yes, I had to look up what an &lsquo;umlaut&rsquo; was.</em></li>
<li>Learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis">what a periapsis <em>is</em></a> was fun. Learning how to spell it was less so.</li>

      <h2>Letterpress now owned by Solebon LLC</h2>
      <p>In non-<em>Firewatch</em> related news, it appears that Letterpress, a critically-acclaimed iOS word game from Loren Brichter&rsquo;s Atebits, is now under the ownership of <a href="http://www.solebon.com/">Solebon LLC</a>.</p>
<p>Letterpress, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id526619424?mt=8">which got updated to version 1.6 today</a>, now lists Solebon LLC as the seller, and the <a href="http://www.letterpressapp.com/">official Letterpress website</a> has been updated to reflect this change in ownership:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Letterpress® is now part of the Solebon family!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Solebon team will be working on many fronts over the next few months to evolve Letterpress.  Players should expect periodic updates delivering performance improvements and innovative new features supported by the responsive team at Solebon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solebon has acquired all of the Letterpress intellectual property including the registered trademark issued in 2013. Any party using the Letterpress brand in an unauthorized manner, including the various cheat services, should cease and desist immediately. Such services illegally encroach on the Letterpress brand and damage the quality of service for our players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letterpress sits near the top of my list of favorite games for iOS. The gameplay is incredibly fun, and its flat-with-shadows design foreshadowed many of the aesthetics we see today in iOS and Google&rsquo;s Material Design. I&rsquo;ve reached out to both Atebits and Solebon for comment, and I&rsquo;ll post an update if I hear back from either company.</p>

      <p>Roff Smith, writing for <em>National Geographic</em>, in an excellent feature about a test that all London cabbies have to pass. It&rsquo;s a long read, but the whole thing is incredibly fascinating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To qualify for that elusive green badge, you need to learn by heart all 320 sample runs that are listed in the Blue Book, the would-be cabbie&rsquo;s bible. You will also have to commit to memory the 25,000 streets, roads, avenues, courts, lanes, crescents, places, mews, yards, hills, and alleys that lie within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Add to that the locations of another 20,000 landmarks and points of interest—pubs, clubs, museums, parks, monuments, railway stations, tube stations, hospitals, schools, police stations, government buildings, embassies, cemeteries, churches, guild halls, theaters, cinemas—any place, in other words, a fare-paying passenger might conceivably ask to be taken or an examiner might challenge you to find.</p>

      <h2>Looping with Liquid</h2>
      <p>In my <code>podcast.xml</code> file, I have a loop that goes through all my posts and identifies which ones are episodes of The Log:</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby %}
for post in site.posts limit:10
if post.layout == &lsquo;post-log&rsquo;
# Do cool loopy stuff
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This was working great, but I began to notice that only the latest two episodes of The Log were being displayed on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-log/id830009186?mt=2">its iTunes page</a>. I spent about an hour searching the web, before I realized my mistake. I originally thought that <code>limit: 10</code> would grab the 10 most recent episodes of The Log, but because the logic of <code>if post.layout == 'post-log'</code> comes inside the loop, Liquid<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> only cycles through the last ten items I&rsquo;ve posted — regardless whether it was an article, link, or episode.</p>
<p>The temporary fix is easy, just remove the limit:</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby %}
for post in site.posts
if post.layout == &lsquo;post-log&rsquo;
# Do cool loopy stuff
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Seems to do the trick, but I may want to look into assigning each episode of The Log a category and looping through that specific category with <code>for post in site.the-log.posts</code>.</p>

      <h2>Lovingly Crafted</h2>
      <p>You&rsquo;re building a chair.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a normal, buy-one-at-the-retail-store kind of chair. Your chair is going to be quality, made of the best materials you can afford, and take months to finish.</p>
<p>You work a little each day to design, measure, cut, sand, test, stain, let dry, and prepare the chair for sale. Once you&rsquo;ve finished, you carefully load the chair into the car and drive off to your store.</p>
<p>At the store, you spend an hour positioning the chair near the front window; you want the lights to hit it <em>just right</em>, as to catch the eye of a passerby. You pull out a beautiful card stock price tag and write down &ldquo;$200.&rdquo; After checking everything for one last time, you flip the sign on your front door to <em>OPEN</em> and wait.</p>
<hr>
<p>Two of my favorite games for iOS are <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a> by Loren Brichter and <a href="http://www.andreasilliger.com">Tiny Wings</a> by Andreas Illiger.</p>
<p>Although the game mechanics are very different — Letterpress a word game, Tiny Wings a side-scrolling adventure — both of these applications are incredibly well designed and executed. Time and care was taken when creating each sound, animation, and graphic. I often use them as examples of exceptional quality when judging other games in the App Store.</p>
<p>Currently, each game takes different approach to pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letterpress is free to download and play. However, it offers an in-app-purchase (IAP) for $1.99 to unlock new color themes and the ability to have more than two games going at a time. This is a one-time purchase and shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with games like &ldquo;Candy Crush,&rdquo; where you&rsquo;re prompted to <em>repeatedly</em> buy extra lives, powers, etc.</li>
<li>Tiny Wings isn&rsquo;t free and costs $0.99 to purchase. However, once you buy a copy, you get access to the full game.</li>

<p>Free for one app ($1.99 for full features), a dollar for the other. However, for as much as I love these games and admire their creators, I&rsquo;ve had to outright argue with my friends about why each app is &ldquo;worth&rdquo; their price, and only barely managed to get my own fiancee to purchase them.</p>

<p>You wait several hours, but your chair has yet to sell. Several individuals comment on how much they appreciate &ldquo;real&rdquo; quality and love your craftsmanship, but they say the price is a little too expensive and they&rsquo;ll wait for a sale.</p>
<p>Some customers ask why you&rsquo;ve priced your chair so high. Didn&rsquo;t you see the price of chairs at <em>retail store</em> down the road? Certainly the chairs there aren&rsquo;t as well-made, but they&rsquo;re only $50. And if (when) those chairs break, <em>retail store</em> sells repair kits for just $25! It&rsquo;ll take a long time before the overall prices are close.</p>
<p>As the end of the day approaches, you go to your front door and flip the sign to <em>CLOSED</em>. Driving back home, you pass by <em>retail store</em> and see several individuals walk out carrying repair kits.</p>

<p>As of the date this article was published, the top ten &ldquo;top grossing&rdquo; iPhone applications are all free. The same is true for iPad-only applications as well.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;free&rdquo; applications making tons of money isn&rsquo;t the problem. Rather, the issue occurs when prospective buyers instantly disregard any app that&rsquo;s not free. This sort of action is often thoughtless and doesn&rsquo;t consider the enormous amount of work, time, and resources a developer put into their piece of software.</p>
<p>Next time you search for an application in the App Store, don&rsquo;t immediately dismiss those which aren&rsquo;t free. Instead, take a few minutes to actually look at the description and screenshots. If you don&rsquo;t like what you see, don&rsquo;t buy it. Just don&rsquo;t <em>never</em> give them a chance, otherwise you&rsquo;ll be missing out on some of the most lovingly crafted software available today.</p>

      <h2>Mactracker.app</h2>
      <p>Writing my last post, I was trying to remember the name of an app I had used that listed the details and specifications of not just every Mac, but also every Apple <em>device</em> ever made. A little searching and I finally found it: <a href="http://mactracker.ca">Mactracker by Ian Page</a>.</p>
<p>Page has versions of Mactracker available for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/mactracker/id430255202?mt=12">OS X</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/mactracker/id311421597?mt=8">iOS</a>, and both versions are completely free. This is a fantastic little app, and it provides a great way to look at Apple&rsquo;s history of products, in entirety, from the beginning to the present.</p>

      <p>Apple, on their <a href="http://www.apple.com/30-years/1-24-14-film/">new &ldquo;1.24.14 Film&rdquo; page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 24, 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh. And with it a promise that the power of technology, put in the hands of everyone, could change the world. On January 24, 2014, we sent 15 camera crews all over the world to show how that promise has become a reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole video was shot using the iPhone 5s&rsquo; built-in camera, compiled on a Mac, and then scored with an original soundtrack — in one day. 100 iPhones were used to shoot the, over, 70 hours of footage.</p>
<p>This may be yet <em>another</em> video of Apple showing how great it is to use their products, but I think what they are subtly trying to say is that the original creativity and personality the Mac remains unchanged to this day.</p>

      <h2>Maybe a love story</h2>
      <p><em>(The following is, if you will, unstructured poetry - I have no idea what it means, even though I wrote it.)</em></p>
<p>There once was a story about love, but that story wasn&rsquo;t ever published. It was a story in the sense that it had a beginning and middle, but, notably, it lacked an end. There was a main character, the protagonist, and many obstacles for him, or was it a her, to overcome. No matter how hard they tried, the story just kept going. One adventure would lead to another. Even the rainy, boring days seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p>The protagonist played his, or maybe her, part extrodinarily well. Transversing through the storyline and weaving their own unique metaphors throughout the fabric of the plot. But this was a story about love, which means that there must be someone <em>to</em> love, and someone to <em>be</em> loved. Can love exist with only one? Maybe, but that&rsquo;s not how this story went.</p>
<p>So it was, that love requried two.</p>
<p>And they lived happily ever after. Forever.</p>

      <h2>Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
      <p>Ah, keyboards. They are the most intimate form of connection we have with our computers. However, for the past couple years, I have given little thought to what actually goes into making a <em>good</em> keyboard.</p>
<p>Aside from the built-in keyboard on my laptop, I have only used several other types of external keyboards. The first few were those that were bundled with any PC &ldquo;package&rdquo; you could purchase at the local Best Buy. However, after I began to develop a slight repetitive strain injury (RSI) a half-year ago, I decided it was time to put a little time — and money — into protecting my wrists and hands.</p>
<p>Hear that echo? It&rsquo;s the rabbit hole that is keyboard research.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-keyboards">Types of Keyboards</h2>
<p>My first round of research showed me that, on the highest level, keyboards are categorized by a single measure: the type of mechanism used in the keys — typically called a switch.</p>
<p>A switch is, essentially, everything from the top of an individual key to the bottom; the entire mechanism. If you&rsquo;ve ever noticed the differences in the way one keyboard feels while you&rsquo;re typing over another, that difference can be equated to the type of switch that particular keyboard is using.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology">Wikipedia page for Keyboard technology</a> lists the 10 different types of keyboard mechanisms out today. The list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Membrane</li>
<li>Dome-switch</li>
<li>Scissor-switch</li>
<li>Capacitive</li>
<li>Mechanical-switch</li>
<li>Buckling-spring</li>
<li>Hall-effect</li>
<li>Laser</li>
<li>Roll-up</li>
<li>Optical</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t already clear, we are only talking about <em>physical</em> keyboards and the mechanisms that are used for the key switches. Although on-screen / software keyboards are far more pervasive than their physical counterparts, the only physical element involved is the glass — of which there is little difference between devices.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Membrane and Dome switches are, for our purposes, the same type of mechanism. These types of keys are typically found in laptop keyboards and could be described as having a &ldquo;mushy&rdquo; feeling. This is due to the rubber or silicone membrane that separates the top of the key from the underlying circuit board. Membrane and dome switches are used in the mass market due to their cheap production costs and durability. Some people enjoy the tactile feeling afforded by these types of switches; however, these are by no means the best typing experience you can get.</p>
<p>Scissor switches are the next rung up on the proverbial typing ladder. Scissor switches, as the name suggests, use a mechanism modeled after a pair of scissors, with two interlocking plastic pieces. One advantage of this design is that it allows for a very thin design, and if you take off any keys from a Macbook, you&rsquo;ll probably find a scissor switch mechanism underneath.</p>
<p>Capacitive switches aren&rsquo;t worth talking about. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to type with them, and, frankly, I find them uninteresting. Also worth ignoring: Hall-effect (interesting, but found in aircraft cockpits, not on your desk), Laser (impractical), Roll-up (ha), and Optical (same category as Hall-effect).</p>
<p>That leaves us with mechanical-switch and buckling-spring keyboards. If you&rsquo;re serious about typing, these are the types of keyboards that you want to look at.</p>
<h2 id="buckling-spring">Buckling-spring</h2>
<p>Originally patented by IBM by Richard Hunter Harris, the buckling-spring keyboard, as the name suggests, uses a spring as the main form of resistance. As a typist presses down on a given key, the internal spring will begin to compress and eventually buckle outward, clacking into the internal casing.</p>
<p>Typing with a Buckling-spring keyboard will be loud, and there are different variants of the mechanism; each with a different level of force required to buckle the spring. From my research, although Buckling-spring keyboards were popular in the early- to mid-90s, their popularity has dropped off significantly over the past decade.</p>
<h2 id="mechanical-switches">Mechanical-switches</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now arrived at, what most consider to be, the final stop for anyone who is serious about typing or gaming: Mechanical-switch keyboards.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Unlike the aforementioned keyboard mechanisms, mechanical keyboards use a single, mechanical switch for every single key. This type of design offers a number of advantages over other keyboard styles, but the main advantage is the array switch types available within the mechanical-keyboard realm.</p>
<h3 id="the-cherry-mx-switches">The Cherry MX Switches</h3>
<p>The Das Keyboard Blog has <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/mechanical-keyboard-guide/#keyswitches">a great writeup</a> that covers the various types of mechanical-key switches available. The most popular style are the Cherry MX Switches, which are created by ZF Electronics GmbH (a German computer peripheral-device maker).</p>
<p>Cherry MX switches come in five different styles: Black, Brown, Blue, Red, and Clear.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Each switch has a different tactile feel (in regards to force required for actuation and the physical &ldquo;bump&rdquo; experience while depressing), and certain colors (Clear, notably) are more difficult to find and purchase than others.</p>
<p>Unlike the buckling-spring keyboards, mechanical-switch configurations have grown to be incredibly popular over the past few years. Sites like <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/">WASD Keyboards</a> allow you to build completely-customized keyboards (down to the color of each keycap) and use whichever Cherry MX switch you want. Because mechanical-switches are incredibly durable and modular, you can replace any switches that fail on a key-by-key basis, which means a mechanical keyboard, with proper care, will last a very long time.</p>
<p>Typically, a good mechanical keyboard will run you around $150. This might seem expensive, but we are not talking about a $15 <em>Logitech Home Keyboard with Media Keys™</em> anymore. A mechanical-switch keyboard is a finely-tuned piece of hardware, designed for those who truly care about their typing speed, accuracy, and performance.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-rsi">Back to RSI</h2>
<p>Mechanical keyboards are widely regarded as the de-facto keyboard for writers, programmers, gamers, or anyone who spends most of their day typing. However, for individuals who suffer from RSI, a change in key-switch type may not be enough to alleviate the strain on their fingers and wrist. Here, a new category of keyboards emerge: ergonomic keyboards.</p>
<p>Up until last year, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/B2M-00012">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a> was one of the only decent, albeit ugly, ergonomic keyboards available. Thankfully, Microsoft updated the Natural line to the, very pretty, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/L5V-00001">Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. At $130, the Sculpt Desktop (keyboard and mouse<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>) is pricey, but after spending most of last August typing in pain, I pulled the trigger and ordered myself one.</p>
<p>It worked. After a week of using the Sculpt Keyboard, the pain in my fingers and upper wrist went away. I felt fine again and could go back to typing on my Macbook Air&rsquo;s built-in scissor-switch keyboard without pain. Like my laptop, the Sculpt Keyboard uses scissor-switch keys, which means that I get a similar tactile feeling when switching keyboards. However, &ldquo;similar&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean &ldquo;great.&rdquo; The scissor-switch keys get the job done, but I would very much like to try a mechanical keyboard and see if the difference is as noticeable as others say.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to continue entertaining the idea of picking up a mechanical keyboard. As someone with mild RSI, I don&rsquo;t want to spend money on something that will, literally, hurt me later on. However, I want to see whether getting a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches, which you don&rsquo;t have to press all the way down to actuate, would provide similar strain-reducing benefits as my current Sculpt setup.</p>

      <h2>Microsoft Employee Badge Redesign</h2>
      <p>Ahmet Alp Balkan recently posted <a href="https://ahmetalpbalkan.com/blog/microsoft-employee-badge-redesign/">his redesign of Microsoft&rsquo;s employee badge</a> or &ldquo;Blue Badge.&rdquo; Balkan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s over a year Microsoft has started to rebrand itself, starting from its logo to a brand new looking OS, from campus shuttles to direction signs on the campus and so on. Many employees are wearing this badge on their belts or pockets every day. So why not redesign this good ol’ beast?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice premise. Plus, I always enjoy seeing designers try their hand at everyday objects that need a little time and love. However, while I like the direction that Balkan went, I had two observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Balkan only shows us the front of the old Blue Badge, while his redesign has both a front and a back. Was there anything on the back of the old one, or was it blank? Perhaps there are printing limitations that limit painting to the front.</li>
<li>I like simplifying the front face of the badge to just the employee name and their picture, but I get the feeling that this design gets in the way of the <strong>primary</strong> reason for the cards in the first place: security. Having all the information on the front of the card, which I assume is worn on the shirt or belt, allows any security personnel or cameras to see everything without having to flip the badge over.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having worked at a global company where these sorts of badges were used, I know the pain it would be to 1.) redesign the card and 2.) reissue them to employees. However, I feel that if Microsoft is dedicated to their new brand and image — and new CEO — this year, if any, might be a great time to start. It&rsquo;s a personal way of unifying everyone under the &ldquo;One Microsoft&rdquo; mantra.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Looks like they&rsquo;re <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/the-new-microsoft-even-the-blue-badges-are-getting-a-redesign/">doing it</a>.</em></p>

      <p>Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/sept14/09-15news.aspx">acquired Mojang</a>, the company behind Minecraft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mojang team will join Microsoft Studios, which includes the studios behind global blockbuster franchises “Halo,” “Forza,” “Fable” and more. Microsoft’s investments in cloud and mobile technologies will enable “Minecraft” players to benefit from richer and faster worlds, more powerful development tools, and more opportunities to connect across the “Minecraft” community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft plans to continue to make “Minecraft” available across all the platforms on which it is available today: PC, iOS, Android, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

<p>Notably lacking: Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Every single kid in my sister&rsquo;s middle school knows about, if not plays, Minecraft [1].

      <h2>Mom</h2>
      <p>You wake up to the sound of your daily alarm. It&rsquo;s 6:25 a.m. — another day of work. It&rsquo;s not too hot, so you put on a long sleeve button-up and a nice pair of khakis. You&rsquo;re glad that you washed everything last night. Throwing your lunch in your bag, you drive off to work.</p>
<p>20 minutes later, you&rsquo;re at your desk. You smile as you text good morning to your new fiancee. You switch your phone to silent and turn on your computer. A coworker needs a little help on a project you&rsquo;re involved in, so you roll your chair across the aisle.</p>
<p>Happy, as you&rsquo;ve just helped fixed a bug, you wheel back over to your desk. You press the power button of your iPhone, expecting to see nothing but the time. You see eight missed text messages and two missed calls. Who&rsquo;s died, you wonder.</p>
<p>You open the text messages from your fiancee first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be ok sweetie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your stomach tightens. You fumble to the messages from your brother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kyle, pick up your damn phone. Mom went down and we&rsquo;re on our way to the hospital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your brain is frozen as you read these words. Adrenaline begins coursing through your body, and your heart is thumping away. Your mind has already left, but your body is just standing still. You walk sprint over to your coworkers desk and say you have to go. What&rsquo;s wrong he asks. My mom is in the hospital.</p>
<p>The words don&rsquo;t sound like words though. You&rsquo;re mouth is numb. Go, your coworker says; he will tell your manager. You hastily throw your computer and notebooks into cubicle drawers and try to lock them with your shaking hands. You miss the keyhole twice before finally getting it closed. You walk-sprint down the aisle and out the door to the stairs.</p>
<p>You get out the door and start running. You sprint. You have more adrenaline in your body than it can output. You don&rsquo;t know which hospital to go towards. You struggle to dial your brother&rsquo;s number. It rings, but he doesn&rsquo;t pick up. Shit. You call again, and he answers this time. What&rsquo;s going on, you demand.
He says we&rsquo;re at the [name] hospital, and that Dad&rsquo;s back there with Mom. [his girlfriend] is there, and people in the waiting room with them.</p>
<p>OK, I say. I&rsquo;ll be there as soon as I can. Drive safe, your brother says.</p>
<p>You get to your car and throw everything into the passenger&rsquo;s seat. You&rsquo;re shaking. While driving, you call your fiancee. It&rsquo;s alright, just drive safe she cautions. The GPS says 45 minutes. Forty. Five. Minutes.</p>
<p>You push the speed limit, but not dangerously. It&rsquo;s probably nothing you say. Is this going to be one of those days where we look silly at the end because of our stress? Don&rsquo;t get yourself worked up. You turn on the radio. The Christian station is playing a song about how sometimes God&rsquo;s mercies come through tears. You silently cry for the rest of the drive.</p>
<p>You arrive at the hospital and go the Emergency Room. Your brother meets you outside. He looks calm. He tells you what happened. The screaming. The CPR. The ambulance. He&rsquo;s lived through hell and a half, but speaks calmly. You follow him into the hospital, careful not to tread on his red cape.</p>
<p>You walk into a private room and are greeted by more people than you thought you&rsquo;d see. Friends of Dad are here. Several siblings of Mom. Your fiancee. Members of the local police and fire department. You say hello to the group. You sisters seem shaken, but fine. Everyone is quiet, everyone having their own little conversation. An hour passes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve only seen Dad once — he briefly came into the room and walked out with one of his coworkers. You decide to go see what the status is. You should, after all. Being the oldest of the family. You should go check on him.</p>
<p>You should have been there too.</p>
<p>Someone takes you down to where Dad is. He&rsquo;s in the doorway of the ICU waiting room, talking with a doctor. He just briefly looks to you and then back to the conversation. He looks tired, and there&rsquo;s a blankness to his eyes. You&rsquo;ll never forget that look.</p>
<p>You wait a couple minutes and then walk back to the waiting room. Before you get there, you see your aunt, who&rsquo;s a doctor, walking towards you. You had heard she was coming. Thank God. The fact she&rsquo;s here is like a shot of endorphins. She hugs you.</p>
<p>You talk for little while, and then she leaves to go speak with your dad. Your fiancee walks over to you, followed by your brother and his girlfriend. The four of you sit by a window. Moving takes too much effort. You stare out at the sky. Several flags are moving slowly in the wind. It might actually turn out to be a nice summer day.</p>
<p>You hear a voice come across the PA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doctors to room [number] stat. Patient attention needed immediately. Doctors to room [number].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see doctors running down the hall. No one says anything about the code. You speak a little about the events leading up to today. A nurse who goes to your church stops and asks if you need anything. Before she goes, your aunt asks whether the code was for your mom&rsquo;s room. It was. But it was a false alarm; a sensor had fallen off.</p>
<p>Your aunt leaves to the ICU again. You haven&rsquo;t seen Dad for a while. You&rsquo;re losing track of any sort of time. You head up to the ICU waiting room to wait with him.</p>
<p>The doctor comes back. Your dad immediately stands up and walks over to him. We&rsquo;re going to have you come back he says. She&rsquo;s really sick. OK he says. My aunt gets up. Take care of him, I tell her before she leaves.</p>
<p><em>She&rsquo;s really sick.</em></p>
<p>Your fiancee leaves to go meet her parents whom just got here. You wait a little bit and then walk down to see them. The sight of your fiancee&rsquo;s mother breaks something inside you. The next time you were suppose to see her was with your family for your engagement party. You feel sick inside. You say a prayer together.</p>
<p>You see your aunt walking towards you from the ICU. Your brother walks down the hall to meet her halfway.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t read her lips, but her facial expressions break your heart.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s shaking her head.</p>
<p>You walk over to her. She says it&rsquo;s not looking good. She says it&rsquo;s time that we get your sisters to come say goodbye.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be your last chance to say goodbye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You walk with your fiancee on your arm into the ICU. You don&rsquo;t know what room Mom&rsquo;s in, but there&rsquo;s only one room with noise coming out of it. Things go blurry as you step across the threshold, but then the room comes into crystal focus:</p>
<p>A nurse is performing CPR on your mother&rsquo;s body, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like <em>her</em> body. Or maybe you don&rsquo;t want it to look like her. Tubes are coming out of her mouth and nose. There&rsquo;s blood in some of them, but what kills you the most is her eyes, her eyes she and you shared, partly open, devoid of life.</p>
<p>You all crowd into the corner with your dad. Your fiancee starts praying. She&rsquo;s praying like you&rsquo;ve never heard her pray before. Her engagement ring catches a small ray of light, and you remember the excited hug Mom gave you three days ago; you didn&rsquo;t think that was your last one. Your eyes fall to the bed, and the body on it, sucking in every single positive emotion you&rsquo;ve ever felt, leaving your mind numb.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;ve been in the room watching. The doctors have a calm demeanor for the chaos. Sometimes, when they stop doing CPR, it&rsquo;s almost <em>quiet</em>. After a couple more minutes, in unison, they all slowly stop working.</p>
<p>You see none of their attempts are helping.</p>
<p>You see your family crying.</p>
<p>You see the doctor turn, explain something medical, and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She&rsquo;s very sick. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything more we can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the worst part is seeing your dad&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s his call, but there&rsquo;s no decision to be made and there probably hasn&rsquo;t been for the last hour. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dad says; the words barely making it out his mouth.</p>
<p>They stop trying. Machines stop beeping. You stop breathing. But you&rsquo;re still crying.</p>
<p>The calling hours, funeral, and weeks will pass by in a blur, yet still feel like an eternity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll come to find out, several weeks later, that the disease was Myocarditis, a rare heart virus, and there was nothing you could have done.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going through a similar situation, I&rsquo;m more than <a href="/">happy to talk or be a listening ear</a>.</p>

      <h2>My Apps and Home Screen</h2>
      <p>You can tell a lot about a person by looking at how they set up their home screen and apps. This is mine as it currently stands on my iPhone 4:</p>
<p><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/2013-09-home-screen.jpg" alt="my iphone"></p>
<p>My home screen is a little more sparse than others, but this allows me to quickly get on and off my phone [without getting too distracted]({% post_url 2013-09-26-kraus-distraction %}).</p>
<h3 id="the-home-screen">The Home Screen</h3>
<ul>
<li>The wallpaper is courtesy of <a href="http://www.twentyfivethree.com/wallpapers/">Bradley Casteneda</a>, who has some real beautiful shots that fit perfectly with iOS 7.</li>
<li>I have a three-icon dock. Four down there feels too crowded, and two feels like I&rsquo;m sacrificing usability for the sake of minimalism. Three feels just right.</li>
<li>I no longer keep Camera or Clock on the first page, they&rsquo;re now tucked away in a folder for misfit apps. Because both are easily launched from Control Center, just a swipe away <em>in any app</em>, it was hard to justify them taking up space.</li>
<li>My apps are arranged in alphabetical order on two planes: the first page and then the dock.</li>
<li>I have no more than two pages of apps at a time. The second page isn&rsquo;t anything special, just two folders: one for apps I use, and one for apps I don&rsquo;t, but can&rsquo;t get rid of.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-apps">My Apps</h3>
<p>My app selection is small, but it works for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>App Store: I&rsquo;m constantly trying out new apps that have unique interfaces, or really great implementations of common ones. I also like to read the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new&rdquo; notes whenever one of my apps gets updated.</li>
<li>Bible: YouVersion&rsquo;s Bible isn&rsquo;t the fastest of the Bible applications I&rsquo;ve tried, but it is the best. Plus, the notes and highlights I make in the app sync to their web interface (<a href="http://bible.com">bible.com</a>) so I can read and study wherever I want.</li>
<li>Messages: I&rsquo;m in love with the new Messages interface for iOS 7. It&rsquo;s fun, colorful, and beautiful. The only thing that could be improved would be <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/381219337534595072">the emojis</a>. <em>Fun tip: when in a message thread, swipe right-to-left to see the timestamps for each message.</em></li>
<li>Newsstand: I use to absolutely loathe Newsstand. I didn&rsquo;t ever download magazines, much less read them on my iPhone. However, after seeing how well designed The New York Times iOS 7 app was, I&rsquo;ve really started to enjoy having high-quality news just a tap away for my daily lunch.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Students: The New York Times (among others), offers a huge discount to subscribers if you have a .edu email address. I&rsquo;m currently on their $.99-for-four-weeks promotion, but I plan on sticking with them through the end of this year. Check out <a href="http://homedelivery.nytimes.com/HDS/CMHome.do?mode=CMHome&amp;CampaignCode=393W8">The NYT&rsquo;s education discount page</a> and remember to always ask about .edu discounts when shopping for software or subscriptions.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Photos: The best camera is the one you have with you. My iPhone has captured so many precious memories of my life that I love having quick access to the most recent ones.</li>
<li>Safari: Without a doubt, one of my favorite apps on iOS. When the iPhone was first released, Safari was the first browser to offer <em>real</em>, modern web browsing for mobile devices. It&rsquo;s only gotten better with iOS 7, and will always have a place on my first page.</li>
<li>Settings: Control Center does 80% of what I typically need Settings for, but I access the other 20% (wallpapers, email settings, check data usage) too often to not have them readily available.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com">You Need A Budget</a> (YNAB): This app has singlehandedly helped me get my finances under control and create a sustainable, responsible budget. The effect has been profound. I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with this app, and am looking to do a full review once I&rsquo;ve been using it a couple more months.</li>
<li>Calendar: I live and die by my calendar. The basic rule of thumb is: if it&rsquo;s not on there, I&rsquo;m not going to it. One particularly useful part of both my fiancee and I having iPhones is that we can share a &ldquo;wedding&rdquo; calendar — so we&rsquo;re both aware of important dates.</li>
<li>Mail: I really don&rsquo;t get that much personal email, but I do get a ton for school. However, to help keep it from overwhelming me, I set the app to only check for new messages every half-hour, and I removed the unread message count badge. Now I check my email when I have time, not when it tells me to.</li>
<li>Vesper: This is [where I collect my thoughts]({% post_url 2013-07-13-vesper %}). It&rsquo;s delightful, simple, and looks great to boot. If you have any appreciation of Field Notes or small caps in typography, <a href="http://vesperapp.co">go check it out</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Each app has been specifically chosen because it&rsquo;s the best at what it does for me. Have a cool home screen or app you really love? I&rsquo;d love to <a href="mailto:comments@kyledreger.net">hear about it</a>.</p>

      <h2>My Frozen Yogurt Recipe</h2>
      <p>After countless trial and error, I have finally settled on, what I believe to be, the best frozen yogurt recipe. If you enjoy vanilla and a good cup of coffee, try this out:</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Base layer of low-fat Vanilla yogurt</li>
<li>Sprinkle with chipped mints</li>
<li>3-5 <em>crushed</em> espresso beans</li>
<li>1-3 <em>crushed</em> raspberries</li>
<li>Lightly top with caramel</li>
<li><del>Vanilla cake batter</del></li>
<li><del>Granola</del></li>
<li><del>Broken up peanuts</del></li>
<li><del>Kiwi</del></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Start with a small base-layer of <del>vanilla cake batter ice cream. Follow up with another light layer of</del> vanilla yogurt. Next, add about a tablespoon of <del>granola to the mix, followed by another tablespoon of</del> chipped mints. If possible, you want to add <del>five to 10</del> 3-5 (holy, caffeine) espresso beans. Next, <del>drop two or three tablespoons of crushed / broken peanuts on top,</del> throw in a few squashed raspberries, and top it all off with a <del>(single) kiwi. Finally, stir in a</del> small amount of caramel syrup. Eat immediately.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Frozen yogurt (froyo) cafes have become quite popular around these parts. And despite the fact that a bowl of frozen yogurt topped with candy, cookies, and flavored toppings is in no way &ldquo;more&rdquo; healthy for you than a bowl of ice cream, I am quite fond of the whole experience.</p>

      <h2>Nature&#39;s distraction</h2>
      <p>My girlfriend and I were recently sitting in the library doing homework when it began to rain outside. The sound of raindrops hitting the roof sounded like a roar of a jet engine right outside the nearby window. A couple of minutes later she asked me if I wanted to see a poem she had written for one of her literature classes. I liked it so much that I asked her for a copy. She graciously agreed and I would like to share it with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s Distraction</p>
<p>Startling pellets of water shoot at the rooftop
First, slow then picking up faster, then louder
Until it makes you stop and look out the window.
The steady build-up of noise,
like the noise of an on-coming train.
In the background, music pouring out of headphones,
secondary to the rain.
My fingers pressing down the keys as I write.
Finally these secondary noises become primary
To the rooftop echo as nature begins to calm.
It is then, I focus on my work,
Until the rain starts again.</p>

      <h2>Nest Protect: Your Smoke Alarm, but Beautiful</h2>
      <p>Nest, the company behind the gorgeous (yes, <a href="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/nest-thermostat.jpg"><em>gorgeous</em></a>) <a href="http://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">thermostat</a>, just released their latest product: <a href="http://nest.com/smoke-co-alarm/life-with-nest-protect/">a smoke and carbon monoxide detector called the Nest Protect</a>. Tony Fadell, C.E.O. of Nest and Apple alumni, on his company&rsquo;s blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was never just about thermostats. At its core, Nest has always been about the home. We reinvent unloved home products to create simple, beautiful, thoughtful things. First we made an entirely different kind of thermostat, because saving energy should be easy. Now we&rsquo;ve reinvented the smoke alarm, because safety is too important to be annoying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the type of innovation I love the most — taking commonplace technology and reimagining how it interacts with us on both a functional and emotional level.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the Protect&rsquo;s demo videos on its product page, and then go read Steven Levy&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/nest-smoke-detector/all/">big write up for <em>Wired</em></a> if you want a closer look at this fascinating little company.</p>

      <h2>New Year&#39;s Habit</h2>
      <p>As I contemplate 2012, less than 12 hours away at this time, I&rsquo;m thinking about the New Year resolutions. While I was thinking, I read a <a href="http://zenhabits.net/fitguide/">post by Leo Babauta on Zen Habits</a> about aiming to create new habits for the new year, rather than setting &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo;. While the article focused on health, there were universal comments about helping to create healthy habits and have them stick. I particularly like this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of creating a list of resolutions this year, create a new habit.
Habits last, and they lead to long-term fitness (and more). They require more patience, but they are worth the wait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changing, or creating, long-term habits are hard. Often times we set unrealistic expectations of what we want to be able to achieve and become disheartened when we can&rsquo;t reach those goals. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t overcome huge obstacles and accomplish great things, but rather we need to be realistic about the journey to get there. A good source of inspiration comes from Matthew 19:26 (NIV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus looked at them and said, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true, just be careful not to change &ldquo;with God all things are possible&rdquo; to &ldquo;with God all things are easy&rdquo;. Change is never easy, but the results and experience along the way are well worth the effort. Be positive, adapt and learn to embrace the journey.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a safe New Year&rsquo;s eve and a great start to 2012.</p>

      <p>Apple and Nike have always had a good relationship (remember the <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1989319,00.asp">Nike + iPod Sport Kit</a>?) so it&rsquo;s little surprise that one of the first &ldquo;big&rdquo; apps to take advantage of the 5S&rsquo;s new activity-monitoring M7 processor is from Nike.</p>
<p>I do wonder how much longer this relationship will last, however, given that Nike has a <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband">whole line of wrist wear</a> designed to do the M7&rsquo;s job <em>without</em> an iPhone. Things will get interesting if Apple ever does enter into the wearable-computing game.</p>

      <h2>Nintendo</h2>
      <p>Nintendo recently said that it is heading towards a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/17/us-nintendo-earnings-idUSBREA0G09M20140117">third consecutive annual loss</a>, induced primarily by the weak sales of their latest console, the Wii U.</p>
<p>If you have followed Nintendo in the news at all the past couple weeks, you know that most news stories have read along the lines of, &ldquo;Is it time for Nintendo to go mobile?&rdquo; — insinuating that Nintendo needs to start pushing out games for iOS and Android if it wants to survive.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the more sensible voices in the should-Nintendo-go-mobile conversation comes from Chris Kohler, who wrote a <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2014/01/nintendo-mobile/">very smart analysis of the whole situation</a> for <em>Wired</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having been at least convinced that it would be too risky for Nintendo to jettison its hardware business entirely, many analysts and commentators are now staking out what they imagine to be a more moderate and sensible position: Nintendo should put some of its games on others’ platforms. This, too, is a logical fallacy, namely <em>argumentum ad temperantiam</em>: the idea if one is faced with two opposing arguments, the correct position must be somewhere in the middle. But suggesting that Nintendo “dip its toe” into mobile app stores is like suggesting that a couple pondering parenthood consider getting just a little bit pregnant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole piece is well researched and intelligently written, and Kohler goes on to argue that Nintendo would attempt a number of other things before ever porting their games to another system, which is exactly what will happen.</p>
<p>When discussing the future of Nintendo, I find it helpful to put them in juxtaposition with a similar company, Apple. Although different in many ways, Apple and Nintendo are cut from the same stone; both want to control every aspect of their users&rsquo; experience, and both do so by building their own world-class hardware and software. Although Apple&rsquo;s App Store is open to all developers and Nintendo&rsquo;s equivalent is not, both companies have profited by doing things in-house.</p>
<p>However, while there is safety in removing the influence of third-parties on your core success, doing so raises the necessity that your own products perform well. In that regard, the Wii U may indeed turn out to be a flop for Nintendo, if it hasn&rsquo;t already. But when looking at the company&rsquo;s ability to weather a financial storm, it helps to remember that, <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-doomed-not-likely-just-take-look-how-much-money-its-got-bank/">buried in Nintendo&rsquo;s financial statement from last year</a>, they have around $10.5 billion in the bank to do with whatever they want or need.</p>
<p>Having that money doesn&rsquo;t make Nintendo invulnerable, but it does buy them several years where they can continue to operate as normal, pursue alternative sources of revenue, and even create their next generation of hardware; all without having to think, even a second, about putting Mario on your iPhone.</p>

      <h2>Obama pledges $4 billion in funding for computer science education in schools</h2>
      <p>Davey Alba, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/obama-pledges-4-billion-to-computer-science-in-us-schools/">reporting for Wired</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the president’s plan, the Department of Education will divide the $4 billion over three years to states that propose well-designed five-year plans to increase computer science access in classrooms. Along with billions in federal funding, the initiative also includes commitments from philanthropists and some of the country’s largest tech companies to help increase opportunities for computer science training, especially for underrepresented groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The medium is the message, and almost all of today&rsquo;s messages are delivered through the medium of computational devices. The next decade is only going to see the network of devices grow, as our homes become collections of connected kitchen scales, light bulbs, and door locks. Providing children with an early entry point to interacting and building for these devices will open up an incredible opportunity for exploration and be creativity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unconvinced, just go look at what kids are creating in Minecraft these days. [1]</p>
<p><strong>Brief aside regarding Minecraft —</strong> You probably already know that Minecraft was acquired by Microsoft back in 2014 for $2.5 billion. However, what you may not have heard is Microsoft, with <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_in_education/archive/2015/06/29/learning-from-educators-to-help-create-dynamic-classroom-experiences-announcements-from-iste-conference.aspx">a goal of helping teachers use Minecraft in the classroom</a>, has since gone and <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/01/19/microsoft-invests-in-new-and-expanded-version-of-minecraft-for-the-classroom-opens-public-preview-of-learning-tools-for-onenote/">acquired MinecraftEdu</a>, a third-party Minecraft version for classroom use. Microsoft plans on rebranding the tools provided by MinecraftEdu as <em>Minecraft Education Edition</em>, along with providing ways for teachers to get mentored on introducing their school and classes to Minecraft. All this to say: the invasion of <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Advanced_redstone_circuits">computer science topics</a> into early education has already started, and the trojan horse is Minecraft. <strong>— End brief aside</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s announcement isn&rsquo;t the first to introduce a major computer science education initiative; the past couple of years have seen momentum build on this front. Late last year, the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/nyregion/de-blasio-to-announce-10-year-deadline-to-offer-computer-science-to-all-students.html">reported on a similar declaration</a> from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, where he outlined a goal of &ldquo;within 10 years all of the city’s public schools will be required to offer computer science to all students.&rdquo; Kate Taylor and Claire Cain Miller reporting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meeting that goal will present major challenges, mostly in training enough teachers. There is no state teacher certification in computer science, and no pipeline of computer science teachers coming out of college. Fewer than 10 percent of city schools currently offer any form of computer science education, and only 1 percent of students receive it, according to estimates by the city’s <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/education_department_nyc/index.html">Department of Education</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had there been some clear path from graduation to the classroom for computer science majors, I would have pursued whatever extra credits were needed for the required certification.</p>

<li>And most of these kids are playing Minecraft on some sort of touchscreen, which I personally find unwieldy. However, over the holidays, I had the chance to watch some of younger cousins play Minecraft on their iPods touch [2], and they had no problem navigating the game world. Furthermore, when I showed them my mouse and keyboard setup, they laughed.</li>
<li>&ldquo;iPod touches&rdquo; just sounds weird, and although I agree that <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7276/plural-of-ipod-touch">the usage of &ldquo;Macbook Pros&rdquo; and &ldquo;iPod Shuffles&rdquo;</a> would suggest &ldquo;iPod Touches&rdquo; is perfectly acceptable, I&rsquo;m going to say to hell with it and just borrow from the far cooler sounding style that gets used when talking about more than one Attorney General: Attorneys General.</li>

      <p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-unlikely-to-make-big-changes-for-next-iphone-1466526489">The Wall Street Journal reported two things</a>: 1.) Apple will be moving to a two-year cycle for major iPhone hardware updates, and 2.) the next iPhone won&rsquo;t have a headphone jack.</p>
<p>And then a majority of the tech press lost its mind. Not so much about the two-year thing, more about the ditching of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)">50 year-old standard</a>. It reminds me of when Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">put the nail in the coffin</a> of Flash on iOS. The industry&rsquo;s visceral response has been nothing short of fascinating.</p>
<p>However, almost two weeks out from the WSJ&rsquo;s report, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/headphone_jacks_are_the_new_floppy_drives">we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know</a>. But it&rsquo;s summertime, a holiday weekend, and my coffee is strong, so let&rsquo;s try and break this down a bit.</p>
<p>Losing the headphone jack would hurt. It&rsquo;s everywhere: planes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/hoodiebuddie-is-a-hoodie-with-earbuds-instead-of-strings/">clothing</a>, and almost every electronic device that can play audio. To even broach the subject of removing this port has your regular, non-technical person asking &ldquo;why?&rdquo; or &ldquo;are you shitting me?&rdquo; Literally. I&rsquo;ve asked a number of them.</p>
<p>The headphone jack is the absolute epitome of &ldquo;it just works,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s what makes Apple&rsquo;s supposed planned abandonment so jarring. What could be simpler than this?</p>
<p>Well, at the moment, we don&rsquo;t have an obvious replacement that is both simpler <em>and</em> has more benefits. Wireless headphones are nice, once you get used to them, but now remember to keep them charged and get frustrated whenever you try to pair them with a new device. Adapters are annoying to keep track of, and the same goes for dongles. Also, I&rsquo;m sure people are less worried about the size of a Lightning-to-audio jack adapter and more concerned that Apple would sell such a thing for $14.99.</p>
<p>No obvious replacement, and an adapter-ridden or Bluetooth-pairing hell. So why replace the headphone jack at all?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take a step back and ask another question: will the headphone jack be around forever? Is that our premise? No, I don&rsquo;t think so. Eventually, something better (or just more modern) will come around to replace it. But who&rsquo;s going to be the first to do it? Here&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going to play the Apple card; because they&rsquo;re the only ones who can actually try.</p>
<p>Apple might be the only company that has the ethos and brand capital to actually pull this sort of transition off. Changing our de-facto audio interface is no small task, and whether the replacement is wireless or some other proprietary method, it&rsquo;s going to hurt. But Apple can push through. The fans will follow first; then, after a year, the redesigned iPhone will pull in a calmer, more adjusted public; and finally, in a few years, we&rsquo;ll look at the headphone jack fondly, but without the reliance we currently have.</p>
<p>Additionally, and what some people have missed is, if Apple <em>is</em> planning on removing the headphone jack, this is, initially, only going to affect people who use Apple products. If history holds true, PC and Android users have nothing to worry about in the short-to-mid term. Even Samsung, who at times has blatantly ripped off the iPhone hardware, might sit this particular design decision out. Apple users will get hit first and need to live with the change for a while.</p>
<p>As a longtime Mac and iPhone user, I&rsquo;m OK with that.</p>
<p>To hear that Apple is considering removing the headphone jack gives me pause, but it&rsquo;s also not out of line with who they are as a company. They want to offer the simplest hardware and software possible, and because they own the whole gamut, it enables them to keep pushing the envelope of what &ldquo;simple&rdquo; means. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve come to expect this particular form of innovation from them.</p>
<p>And yes: Apple hasn&rsquo;t always innovated well, and I can&rsquo;t say that removing the headphone jack isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/21/11991302/iphone-no-headphone-jack-user-hostile-stupid">user hostile and stupid</a>. But similar things were said about removing the VGA port, the DVD drive, and Flash. Yet, when we get through the transition, things are generally both better and simpler.</p>
<p>To that end, I think a reasonable view of the situation is this:</p>
<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t think the future of getting audio into our ears is reliant on a 50 year-old standard. I imagine most innovative technology companies think that way. However, while the headphone jack is incredibly simple, cheap, and permeated throughout society, Apple is one of the only companies who could actually orchestrate the move to the next thing. An audio interface that can do more in different and better ways.</p>
<p>If Apple&rsquo;s decided to do this, it&rsquo;s done. The next iPhone is already well into production for release in the Fall. Now we just wait and see.</p>

      <h2>On the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
      <p>The very first website I ever designed was the horrifically-named Linkag3verywhere.com. I built it with the intention of displaying a curated list of links to online games, websites and articles I found interesting. I gave the address out to my cousins and friends, and remember being thrilled to see the (mostly generated directly by me) page visits go up every day. I still have the Linkag3verywhere.com code in a folder of archived projects, and every now and again I&rsquo;ll go pull up the original design.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure any designer can attest, the first foray into the world of web design left much to be desired in terms of final product. Nonetheless, I had a passion to improve, so I spent hours online finding websites I thought were well designed and peeking in at their source code. The fact that every cool design trick I saw was only a click away made the whole experience of learning the craft intoxicating.</p>
<p>As I improved, I got to a point where people would actually pay me for the work I did. I decided that I needed a logo for myself, something official that would inspire confidence in my abilities. As I began sketching, I felt incredibly lucky being born into the family name &ldquo;Dreger&rdquo; given that the alliteration between &ldquo;Dreger&rdquo; and &ldquo;design&rdquo; was pleasing to both hear and say. Going off of a double-D letterform, I eventually settled on a draft I was happy with and went about polishing the pixels. Once a final design had been reached I, very proud of my work, showed it to a group of classmates and a teacher. With a smile on my face, I explained the process I took and the subtitles behind the concept. When I finished, I expected a pat on the back and nods of approval, but what I actually got was incredibly disheartening.
My logo, although unique to my eyes, bared an unknowingly-inspired look from the <a href="http://www.dcshoes.com/">DC Shoes icon</a>. One of my friends immediately pointed this out, and a quick Google search showed the dreadful similarity. My logo instantly felt cheap, and I felt embarrassed. When I got back to my laptop, I promptly removed any trace of the identity from my website.</p>
<hr>
<p>I still remember the embarrassment to this day. In fact, it stopped me from designing anything for the next couple weeks. Instead, becoming absorbed in my school work, I ignored the little moments of inspiration that hit me throughout the day — casting them as just another opportunity to unknowingly copy someone else&rsquo;s idea and suffer ridicule for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to have now matured past that ideology of thinking. For even though I eventually got back to coding and pushing pixels, my hiatus was unjustly taken and an insult to my own creativity. It was only later on I was exposed to the idea that <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/">Everything is a Remix</a>. That even though originality is the purest form of creation, most of what I will ever accomplish pays both tribute, in spirit and being, to the work of others.</p>
<p>Although my arrival to the remix notion was later than others, Isaac Newton beat us all to the idea when he eloquently put, &ldquo;if I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&rdquo; While Newton was undoubtedly speaking about the physicists and mathematicians that came before his time, the web design culture today is a fantastic example of his sentiment. In fact, what&rsquo;s so wonderful about our field is that some of the individuals I consider my &ldquo;giants&rdquo; are actually younger than myself.</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the idea that everything we build is a remix of someone else&rsquo;s work, I&rsquo;d like to reflect on some of the qualities I&rsquo;ve noticed these &ldquo;giants&rdquo; tend to have.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a Giant has an innate ability to adapt and persevere through difficult moments in life. All of the great things that we, Team Human, have ever accomplished were not easily obtained. Accompanying that sentiment, the attitude one must have when approaching something difficult is to Embrace the Suck and push through.</p>
<p>Giants seem to thrive off these demanding situations, and we already have <a href="https://square.com/">hundreds</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/">of</a> <a href="http://facebook.com/">examples</a> of what can happen when they eventually overcome them.
Another quality I admire of the Giants is their never-ending source of inspiration on which to draw from for new ideas.</p>
<p>However, one of the paradigms designers get caught in is thinking inspiration only comes from browsing new work and content within our field. I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a>, but I don&rsquo;t often go there when I&rsquo;m looking to satisfy a need for &ldquo;inspiration.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve found that if you want true inspiration, you need to widen your view beyond the resolution of your monitor.</p>
<p>For me, I read, draw, or play the piano. It is said that Wolfgang Mozart loved to do card tricks and Leonardo da Vinci had a passion for riding horses. Going outside your field of work can do wonders for your inspiration, as it exposes you to the stories outside your own. At the very least, shut your computer off and take a walk outside. Heck, maybe even leave your phone as well.</p>
<p>The final thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about Giants is less a quality of their character, and more a statement about their online personas. I&rsquo;ve often found that some of the Giants whose blogs or Twitter feeds I visit are infrequently updated. However, this should never to be take as a negative thing. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the Giant is too lazy to update their site, rather they&rsquo;re too busy building awesome things to stop and let you know about it until they&rsquo;re done.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not yet a Giant, but that&rsquo;s the beauty about our industry — anyone can be given enough time and the right attitude. You and I may never create something on the level of <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> (a massively-popular web framework), but so long as we never stop chasing the ideals of the Giants and striving to help others around us, our work may one day be the foundation for someone else to build on.</p>
<p>God willing, my work may get to that point one day. But for now, there&rsquo;s still plenty of joy to be had in the journey, and maybe that&rsquo;s the most important part of it all anyway.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been one year since I started dating my girlfriend. She is my best friend, someone I confide in all the time and my spiritual support. I&rsquo;ll never forget the day she invited me to coffee, our first date, and how I made sure to ask her back &ldquo;same time, same place&rdquo; the next day.</p>
<p>I could not have asked God for a better partner and I thank Him for her every day. I ask that He look over us as we embark on another year together and that we remember that nothing is too big for Him to handle. I cannot wait to keep growing with her.</p>
<p>Love you, sweetheart.</p>

      <h2>Out of Office</h2>
      <p>Due to unforeseeable internet conditions over the next few days, I&rsquo;m putting KDHQ on break for March 27 through March 30.</p>
<p>At 8am tomorrow, I leave with a group of students to attend the <a href="http://ecwca.org/">East Central Writing Centers Association&rsquo;s</a> annual conference. I&rsquo;ll be speaking on a panel, answering questions about how today&rsquo;s writing and communication centers can offer better services to their students, with a focus on new technologies.</p>
<p>Aside from the conference itself, I am really looking forward to catching up on some reading — my digital to-read list is overflowing. Hopefully this will give me some good fodder for new articles once I get back. Thanks for reading, and see you next week.</p>

<p>Back in the day, folks would turn to friends with questions. Then came the web and search engines. These days most of us go straight to a search engine. Increasingly, people are asking on social media (which can sometimes be awkward). We think there is another way to get high quality answers without sifting through an ocean of “results.”</p>

<p>I laughed at the asking-questions-on-social-media-is-awkward bit, because I&rsquo;ll bet you Jelly&rsquo;s iOS app prompts for access to my Twitter accounts or Contacts, so they can find those people who, you know, it was awkward to ask things before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The courage culture paints a tempting picture of how people end up with remarkable lives. It tells a story where you&rsquo;re the main character, fighting evil forces, and ultimately triumphing after a brief but intense battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is decidedly less exciting. Remarkable careers require that you become remarkably good. This takes time. But not necessarily a string of defiant rejections of some mysterious status quo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we all prepare to go on to whatever&rsquo;s &ldquo;next&rdquo; in our life, it&rsquo;s important to remember that success isn&rsquo;t always hinged on bravely just &ldquo;going for it&rdquo;; it also encompasses putting in the effort to become <strong>great</strong> at what we do.</p>

      <h2>PCWorld&#39;s review of Firewatch: 3/5</h2>
      <p>Last one for the night. Hayden Dingman, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3030271/software/firewatch-review-lots-of-smoke-but-no-spark.html">covering the game for PCWorld</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Firewatch</em> is beautiful. <em>Firewatch</em> is intriguing. But ultimately I don&rsquo;t think <em>Firewatch</em> is very good. At its best, this is a quiet game about two characters struggling with real-life insecurities. But when that&rsquo;s sidelined to make room for a main plot, <em>Firewatch</em> suffers. It&rsquo;s a game perfect for trailers, a game full of excellent dialogue and breathtaking moments and stunning vistas that ultimately amounts to nothing much at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/firewatch/critic-reviews">Metacritic</a> and <a href="http://opencritic.com/game/2129/firewatch">OpenCritic</a>, sites that aggregate reviews, peg <em>Firewatch</em> at 82/100. I don&rsquo;t expect <em>Firewatch</em> to set the world on fire, but I feel it&rsquo;s going to be one of those games that raises the bar. Knockout graphics, great voice acting. Expect to hear about this one for the next couple of weeks.</p>

      <h2>Podcasting Diaries</h2>
      <p>One of my goals for this semester is to start a small podcast. I have always loved public speaking, and I truly enjoy finding the stories of other people. Hopefully this will give me the chance to do just that.</p>
<p>After buying an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VA464S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kyldre-20">awesome microphone</a> [referral link], I spent the first few days just playing with various audio settings and was able to get a feel for how the microphone handles different environments. Next, I came up with some topics I wanted to discuss with a guest, and I set up a time to record. Finally, tonight, I recorded the first episode.</p>
<p>Even though the first show is recorded, edited, and ready to go, I want to get two or three more episodes set up before publishing anything. If everything goes well, you can expect to see an announcement next week.</p>
<p>Having gone through the whole process from idea to production, I have a few notes to share, and will continue to share as I learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the host and guest keep the same distance away from the microphone. My Blue Yeti Mic works great, but there will be a noticeable volume difference unless both parties keep the same distance.</li>
<li>Find a quiet room with decent acoustics. This comes into play if you raise your voice above a certain threshold (you may hear a slight echo), but having a quiet room and a quality mic are two of the best ways to keep the audio clean.</li>
<li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> works great for my purposes right now. For post-production, I found that Normalizing the audio, followed by Amplifying any quiet spots really helped.</li>
<li>It is OK to cut tangents from the recording. At first, I wanted to post an unabridged version of the audio I recorded, but after listening through the first take, I found that some tangents had gone too far off course. Cutting them was painful, but the whole show flows much better now.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t interrupt the guest while they are talking. Even small verbal ticks like &ldquo;mhm&rdquo; or &ldquo;yea&rdquo; are <em>really</em> distracting outside the context of actually being a part of the conversation.</li>
<li>People are interesting. I found my first guest to be entertaining and a lot of fun to talk with, despite not coming from a design or technology background, which were some of the topics we discussed. I found that his unique perspective added a really nice tone to the episode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This first episode was fun, but I know that there are plenty of places I can improve — both as a host and a producer. I am still debating over where the podcast will live once ready (on kyledreger.com or its own domain), and I have not yet settled on a name. Nonetheless, I now have one good episode and could not be more excited to record the next.</p>

      <h2>Podcasting Diaries 2</h2>
      <p>Now that <a href="/log">The Log</a> is officially up and running, I wanted to add another post to [my series]({% post_url 2014-02-06-podcasting-pt-1 %}) on things I have learned behind the mic.</p>
<h3 id="the-audience">The audience</h3>
<p>I am not the best show host quite yet. Although not yet published, I have recorded a couple of 30+ minute interviews with a variety of guests from around campus. While interviewing them, I quickly realized the importance of having a good set of questions or list of topics to help keep a common narrative throughout the show. All my guests have been great so far, but there were times when a more structured layout could have been helpful.</p>
<h3 id="the-topics">The topics</h3>
<p>Outside the interviews (those are special episodes), I want a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; episode of The Log to be relatively casual. However, even the most casual of episodes talking about the technology industry will inevitably use some quote or figure that then needs cited and referenced. This can be overwhelming to do beforehand, since I often don&rsquo;t know which direction a show will end up going, but I have found that post-production is a great time to 1.) make edits and 2.) go grab all the sources I mention while talking.</p>
<h3 id="limit-to-three-takes">Limit to three takes</h3>
<p>I would re-cut a section of audio until it sounded perfect, if I could. However, I have imposed a three-take limit for any given section of an episode. This figurative limit helps me not get caught up on trying to sound perfect and helps keep me sounding natural, instead of too rehearsed.</p>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p>I am really happy that I didn&rsquo;t tag the word &ldquo;daily&rdquo; on to the show — not because I couldn&rsquo;t do an episode a day; rather, I don&rsquo;t want any of the shows to sound forced or be extremely short due to lack of content. Having some flexibility for the slow news days is going to be nice down the road.</p>
<h3 id="recording-setup">Recording setup</h3>
<p>I am currently using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net">Audacity</a> to do all my audio recording, and all audio is captured via the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VA464S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kyldre-20">Blue Yeti Microphone</a> [affiliate link]. To keep the file size down, I export my audio around 120 kbps with a constant bit rate mode. For spoken-word podcasts, this seems to offer a nice quality-to-file-size ratio.</p>
<p>As my foray into the podcasting world continues, I&rsquo;ll update this series with any new thoughts or tips I come across. Currently, one of the biggest things I want to ensure is that I don&rsquo;t forget to <em>write</em> in the midst of all this recording and editing. How ironic that would be, no?</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading and listening, and be sure to check out the <a href="/log">latest episode</a> of The Log with special guest Emily Mariani, my fiancee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Delilah and Henry represent an emerging trend in games, of paired characters who are individually and collectively simpatico but who struggle with their own anxieties and with one another&rsquo;s perceived shortcomings. Their relationship has form and shape, though it shimmers and shifts as the story progresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These two characters are written with a conviction and authenticity rarely seen in video games. Neither of them is idealized, not even for a second. Their self-doubts and flaws are carved into the script and into the optional responses. Their ordinariness is what makes them so appealing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The echoing refrain I&rsquo;ve heard about <em>Firewatch</em> is that it&rsquo;s very well written, and the voice acting is just great.</p>

<p>Prepare today so you can do tomorrow what you couldn&rsquo;t do yesterday.</p>

<p>Sounds like a quote straight out of a self-help book, but there&rsquo;s some real inspiration in there. Work hard to become a better, more healthy and loving person every day.

      <h2>Presentation: Mobile Web and Applications</h2>
      <p><strong>Update:</strong> The <em>Alliance Review</em> has posted <a href="http://www.the-review.com/local%20news/2014/02/15/chamber-seminar-focuses-on-mobile-technology">the online version of the article</a> that covered my presentation.</p>
<p>Whew, last week was packed for me. If you noticed the irregular publishing schedule, I apologize. Let me show you what took up most of my time.</p>
<p>About three months ago, I was asked by my university&rsquo;s Office of Marketing to create a presentation about mobile applications. The audience would be a mix of business- and marketing-focused professionals, and my job was to both educate and advise as to the current state of mobile applications.</p>
<p>Although it does not have my notes, you can see the slides I created below. This should help you get a feeling for the direction and areas I focused on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your browser does not have JavaScript turned on. Please visit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my presentation on SpeakerDeck<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to see it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At a high level, the outline went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>To start, I focused on the beginning of the mobile application revolution, which I identify as the time after Apple introduced the iPhone.</li>
<li>Next, I moved to the unique differences between web applications and native applications.</li>
<li>Finally, I showed some off some of the companies who are doing interesting things between their existing websites and their mobile efforts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole presentation went very well. It was truly an honor to present to those in attendance, and I would like to thank everyone involved with helping make it a success.</p>
<p>One of the last slides I used was of a photographer, and I closed with the following lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite sayings is &ldquo;the best camera is the one you have with you.&rdquo; But let me turn this around a bit and say: &ldquo;the best customer is the one you can always be with.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Read Different</h2>
      <p><em>By guest editor, Christopher B. Durr.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you want to be a better scientist? Study architecture, cooking, economics, mechanics. Go outside your field and ask questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s some of the best advice I have ever been given. Too often we view the same sites on the Internet over and over again <em>ad nauseam</em>. Facebook, news, e-mail, rinse and repeat. The news is great for information but short on inspiration. Here are some of my favorite sites to get you thinking (about something else).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>
<p>Architecture — A great amalgamation of Art + Engineering + Science, architecture and design is everywhere, not just in the buildings we see everyday. Have you ever thought about how useless a ceramic coffee mug would be without the simple addition of a handle? Thinking like an architect helps me approach problems from a different angle. My favorite site for inspiration is <a href="http://www.architecturaldigest.com/">Architectural Digest</a>, which covers a range of topics that keep me thinking. As a bonus, I now know exactly how I&rsquo;ll design my imaginary house on Cape Cod.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food — Cooking is just chemistry you can eat.[1] While there are plenty of places to go for recipes, the people over at <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/">Epicurious</a> get the nod. Sure, it gets a little Buzzfeedy with headlines like, &ldquo;17 must try recipes,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m willing to overlook the listicle[2] format because it&rsquo;s all so well designed.

<p>Stats — We here at AF love our tables, charts and graphs. Like it or not, we now live in a world of Big Data, where even the Weather Channel can determine when people are most likely to <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/weather-can-predict-whether-you-want-beer-156404">buy beer, yogurt, chocolate</a>. With all this data flying around, we need smart people to distill it all down into something usable. Nate Silvers&rsquo; website <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> does just that. Their specialities are sports and politics, but there&rsquo;s plenty to explore on their site. For example, I once read an article about what people put on their sandwiches, and I slept a little bit easier knowing that someone was working on that question, and I didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>Photography — Photography, like architecture, is another subject that&rsquo;s right on the border of Technology and Art. Sure, you need to think about color and staging and light, but you also need to think about shutter speed, detector gain, and focal lengths. One of my favorite websites for photography is Trey Ratcliff&rsquo;s blog <a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/">Stuck in Customs</a>. His style tends to lean towards High Dynamic Range photography, which is an acquired taste, but his <a href="http://stuckincustoms.smugmug.com/">portfolio</a>
is undeniably breathtaking, and his adventures around the world make for interesting reading.</p>

      <h2>Reducing Cognitive Friction</h2>
      <p>Shawn Blanc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computers are great at doing the boring, automated stuff we don’t like to do. So why not automate common tasks (like performing backups of your computer), pre-make decisions for your computer to carry out on your behalf (such as auto-filing certain email newsletters), and generally just find ways to make yourself more efficient?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the biggest reason we don’t do these things is because we don’t care. Seriously. In the moment, it seems easier to just continue suffering through our broken and inefficient workflows that it does to take a step back and consider if there’s a better way.</p>

      <h2>Reeder 2 for Mac Beta</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been a long-time fan of Silvio Rizzi&rsquo;s <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder 2 for iOS</a>. Reeder is an excellent RSS client, and it remains my preferred way to consume news feeds on the go.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Rizzi <a href="https://twitter.com/reederapp/status/454642789557747712">announced a public beta of Reeder 2 for Mac</a>. Anyone who wants to try the software before it is, presumably, sold on the Mac App Store can <a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/">check it out here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty picky about the software I use to read news feeds with, particularly since I can go through hundreds of articles a day. My current setup is Balazs Varkonyi&rsquo;s <a href="http://readkitapp.com">ReadKit</a>, which I&rsquo;ve been enjoying for the past couple months. Nevertheless, there&rsquo;s nothing I like more than when my favorite apps get competition, and the Reeder 2 for Mac beta takes some big steps towards hijacking my current workflow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with the iOS client, you will feel right at home in the Mac beta. The animations, icons, and navigational hierarchy found in the iOS client have been lovingly carried over, and the Mac beta exhibits many design decisions that create a nice subdued-skeumorphism middle ground between iOS and OS X .</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are five built-in color schemes available. From left to right: Reeder, Dark Reeder, Light Reeder, Standard, and Dark White. Outside of each theme, there is not a lot of customization you can do (article display options are not available with this beta), but I found the standard Reeder theme to be perfectly fine for reading.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The most prominent influence from iOS comes in the Mac beta&rsquo;s Preferences window. Look at the rounded toggle switches and list view. Surprisingly, iOS design conventions feel much more at home in an OS X app than I thought they would. As a growing number of consumers get an iPod, iPhone, and iPad as their <em>first</em> device, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see future OS X interface elements borrow more heavily from their iOS counterparts.</p>
<p>Reeder currently supports Feedbin, Feedly, Feed Wrangler, and Fever as syncing protocols. It also supports local RSS, for those who don&rsquo;t use any of the aforementioned services.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of my favorite features in the Mac beta is the Minimized Layout view, which condenses everything down into a nice, clean layout.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you click (or arrow over) to a story, the sidebar disappears, leaving nothing but a simple window for the text. A bar at the bottom of each article lets you click to the next story, but I prefer to use the arrow keys and keyboard shortcuts to navigate within the app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At their smallest widths, Reeder 2 beta is 47% smaller than ReadKit, which is something I appreciate on my 13-inch Macbook Air. If you&rsquo;re on an even smaller screen (11-inch Macbook Air or you want multiple windows open at the same time), Minimized Layout is a great way to save precious screen space without sacrificing functionality.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m impressed with this beta. I won&rsquo;t be switching to Reeder full time, but I do plan to flip between it and ReadKit over the next week or so. It&rsquo;s interesting to see the various iOS interface elements make their way into OS X, and, if Rizzi keeps them in future betas, this could become an important convention for developers to consider.</p>

<p>You could argue the old adage that &ldquo;good artist copy, great artist steal.&rdquo; But <em>extraordinary</em> artists steal great features, refine them, and then implement a better version. Samsung thinks copying features is enough, continuously duplicating other competitors without adding any real value. For them, it&rsquo;s a race to add bullet points to a list of features.</p>

      <h2>Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO</h2>
      <p>This evening, Microsoft announced that Satya Nadella, previously the Executive Vice President of Cloud and Enterprise, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/feb14/02-04newspr.aspx">will be appointed to the position of CEO</a>. Nadella becomes only the third CEO in the company&rsquo;s history. From the official press page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;During this time of transformation, there is no better person to lead Microsoft than Satya Nadella,&rdquo; said Bill Gates, Microsoft&rsquo;s Founder and Member of the Board of Directors. &ldquo;Satya is a proven leader with hard-core engineering skills, business vision and the ability to bring people together. His vision for how technology will be used and experienced around the world is exactly what Microsoft needs as the company enters its next chapter of expanded product innovation and growth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading down towards the bottom of the page, you can also find this interesting tidbit regarding Bill Gates&rsquo; new role at the company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft also announced that Bill Gates, previously Chairman of the Board of Directors, will assume a new role on the Board as Founder and Technology Advisor, and will devote more time to the company, supporting Nadella in shaping technology and product direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to hear that Gates is sticking around, particularly after Barb Darrow <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/02/04/the-biggest-microsoft-question-what-about-bill/">reported for Gigaom</a> that several Microsoft board members &ldquo;had advocated that Gates leave the board so that the new CEO wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with a founder looking over his shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While reading the press release, I admit that outside of Nadella&rsquo;s name being mentioned as a possible contender for the CEO position, I had not heard much about him. But after reading his <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/feb14/02-04mail2.aspx">first company-wide email as CEO</a>, I find myself silently cheering for the guy. From the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we look forward, we must zero in on what Microsoft can uniquely contribute to the world. The opportunity ahead will require us to reimagine a lot of what we have done in the past for a mobile and cloud-first world, and do new things. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This starts with clarity of purpose and sense of mission that will lead us to imagine the impossible and deliver it. We need to prioritize innovation that is centered on our core value of empowering users and organizations to &ldquo;do more.&rdquo; We have picked a set of high-value activities as part of our One Microsoft strategy. And with every service and device launch going forward we need to bring more innovation to bear around these scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nadella&rsquo;s words come off genuine, and they feel far more realistic and sensible than Ballmer (on paper or in person) ever appeared to be.</p>
<p>Finally, Microsoft has put together <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/ceo/index.html">a (truly) beautiful micro-site</a> that introduces the new CEO with photos, a bio, and several videos featuring Nadella himself, Gates, and Ballmer.</p>
<p>It is more than clear the company is very excited, and I think Microsoft fans should be too.</p>

      <h2>Search and destroy</h2>
      <p>One of the hardest parts of keeping on top of your schedule at college is actually <em>knowing</em> what you have to do. Most of us get the work done, but sometimes I find myself wanting to avoid having to see what I need to do for a project. What little motivation I have is further squandered when I have to go out of my way to check on assignments; whether they&rsquo;re online, or the teacher sends them out after class.</p>
<p>The best way I&rsquo;ve found to keep track of, and actually do, the work I&rsquo;m assigned is to get into a mindset of actively seeking out my tasks. Once I do that, I take 30 seconds and asses how long a given assignment is going to take me. Suddenly, things get a lot easier. Even though the difficulty of the task may not have changed, at least now I am aware of the time and energy it will take to complete, which allows me to schedule my day around my work more effectively.</p>
<p>Stay away from throwing the task into a long list of todo items. Rather, actually block off time in your day to attack the assignment. Half an hour between lunch and class? Start your Intro to Psychology flashcards. Make an appointment with your tasks and keep to them.</p>
<p>Search for your work. Assess how long it will take to complete. Mark it into your schedule. Do it.</p>

      <p>Fascinating little anecdote about how <em>The New York Times&rsquo;</em> issue number <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/the-em-new-york-times-em-had-a-mistake-on-its-front-page-every-day-for-more-than-a-century/283076/">was off by 500 for more than a century</a>. Rebecca J. Rosen for <em>The Atlantic</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy enough to imagine the scene: A worker, late at night, setting the paper&rsquo;s front-page type. He takes out the type from the preceding day&rsquo;s paper. He looks at the issue number—14,499—and adds one. He gets 15,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps he misread the number, and thought he saw 14,999 in its place. Or perhaps he&rsquo;d had a long night, and just wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight. Who knows? What we know is that he put 15,000 as the issue number for the next day, and nobody noticed.</p>

      <h2>Shutting Down Facebook Paper</h2>
      <blockquote>
<p>A year ago, Facebook announced a new News Feed that was completely redesigned to focus on content–it had large photos, big user icons, better integration with Facebook messenger, and it brought Facebook’s website into closer alignment with its mobile apps. It was beautiful. During the few months I was able to use the new design, my Facebook experience was significantly better. Here’s what it looked like:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dcurt.is/facebooks-predicament">That&rsquo;s Dustin Curtis, back in 2014</a>, in a post titled &ldquo;Whatever goes up, that&rsquo;s what we do.&rdquo; His title refers to how Facebook (supposedly) kill really good designs if they don&rsquo;t increase engagement. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how beautiful the idea; if the numbers don&rsquo;t go up, neither will the design.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the above piece because, announced today, Facebook is shutting down Paper, an alternative to their main iOS app. Here&rsquo;s Casey Newton, reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is shutting down Paper, a bold reimagining of the company&rsquo;s flagship app for iOS that impressed critics but failed to attract a large audience, the company said today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] Paper signaled the beginning of a design renaissance at Facebook. The look and feel of the app were orchestrated by Mike Matas, whose design firm Push Pop Press was acquired by Facebook in 2011. Paper was notable for the novel animations it used to guide you through the app — tap on a link and it would unfold like a letter; pull down on the story and it would fold back up, returning you to the feed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Matas&rsquo; influence in Paper was obvious to anyone who followed <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_matas?language=en">his work at Push Pop Press</a>. Each animation and interaction felt intentional. It was one of the most enjoyable apps I&rsquo;ve every used on iOS. Facebook felt <em>fundamentally</em> different when viewed with Paper.</p>
<p>Back to Mr. Newton, Facebook&rsquo;s Instant Articles feature (the near-instant loading of news stories that Facebook pre-caches for you) borrows a number of design elements born from Paper. Finally, here&rsquo;s Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal with Paper was to explore new immersive, interactive design elements for reading and interacting with content on Facebook, and we learned how important these elements are in giving people an engaging experience.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Engaging isn&rsquo;t the right word; emotional is. Paper was that good.</p>

      <h2>Sidebar design</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m designing a sidebar for a web application, which has a typical header-sidebar-content layout. The header holds the main navigation, the content area has content, but the sidebar has a lot more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two primary action buttons (think &ldquo;create x&rdquo; type).</li>
<li>Two collapsible lists of content (you click the header to collapse the list).</li>
<li>Two lists that are not collapsible.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put a lot in that sidebar, arguably too much. There are too many competing methods of interacting with the content, and it&rsquo;s not clear what the user can actually click. One possible solution would be to have the sidebar serve a more traditional <em>navigation</em> role, but that would uproot our two buttons, which aren&rsquo;t used for navigating.</p>
<p>Everything in the sidebar has to stay for now. Sidestepping the buttons / navigation conflict, the biggest design challenge is creating enough visual distinction between a collapsible list and a list that&rsquo;s static. Right now, we have a small chevron floating to the right of the list title that denotes collapsible functionality. That works OK right now, but the collapsible / non-collapsible list titles look so similar that I&rsquo;m concerned the user won&rsquo;t notice the difference.</p>
<p>Do the lists need the ability to collapse? Yes. The content of each list can get quite long. One possible solution would be to have <em>all</em> lists be collapsible. That would remove the ambiguity, and it would make the interaction with each list header consistent.</p>

      <h2>Sleep and Winding Down</h2>
      <p>Tony Schwartz, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/07/the-secret-to-high-performance/">writing for the <em>Harvard Business Review</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no single behavioral change we’ve seen in our work with thousands of executives that more quickly and powerfully influences mood, focus, and productivity than a full night’s sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schwartz&rsquo;s story revolves around an experimentation with Kevin Crain, a Managing Director at Bank of America, and his sleep schedule. Schwartz also later goes on to cite <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/09/sleep-medical-research">a study at the University of Warwick</a>, which linked a lack of sleep (less than 6 hours a night) to a 48% increase in the likelihood of developing or dying from heart disease. That number, <em>nearly 50%</em>, is unnerving. Sleep and heart health go hand-in-hand far more than I ever thought.</p>
<p>Even more disconcerting, particularly in college, is the powerful and pervasive stigma surrounding any bedtime before 11 p.m. Personally, I have had weeks where 5-to-6 hours of sleep a night were common. My body may be able to handle it now, but forming any sort of habit around this practice is dangerous.</p>
<p>Sleep, and water, are incredibly critical to our overall health. Schwartz talks about a number of benefits that resulted in the tweaking of Crain&rsquo;s sleeping habits, but one of the best tips I took away was this: set a specific time to go to sleep and begin winding down at least 30 minutes before. Most days I make it in bed by 11:30 p.m., but I will have just come from several hours of programming or writing, making it near impossible to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good time to audit our sleeping habits, no?</p>

      <h2>Some More Details on Touch ID&#39;s Security</h2>
      <p>For the typical consumer, Apple has not gone too far in explaining the details behind Touch ID&rsquo;s security. We know that your fingerprint data never leaves the Secure Enclave (a small, physical chip embedded on the processor), and that applications are restricted from ever asking for that data. However, for those of us who want to know more, particularly businesses, Apple has updated the security document that accompanies their <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/">iPhone in Business</a> website to include a plethora of information.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf">&ldquo;iOS Security&rdquo; PDF document</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touch ID can be trained to recognize up to five different fingers. With one finger enrolled, the chance of a random match with someone else is 1 in 50,000. However, Touch ID allows only five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before the user is required to enter a passcode to obtain access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally, 1 in 50,000 seemed low to me. But considering that Touch ID only scans the part of your finger that touches the sensor, it seems more reasonable as there is less surface area to work with.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In regards to the image that the sensor captures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 88-by-88-pixel, 500-ppi raster scan is temporarily stored in encrypted memory within the Secure Enclave while being vectorized for analysis, and then it&rsquo;s discarded after. The analysis utilizes subdermal ridge flow angle mapping, which is a lossy process that discards minutia data that would be required to reconstruct the user&rsquo;s actual fingerprint. The resulting map of nodes never leaves iPhone 5s, is stored without any identity information in an encrypted format that can only be read by the Secure Enclave, and is never sent to Apple or backed up to iCloud or iTunes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, if someone wanted to steal your fingerprints, it would be easier for them to somehow get one of your <em>actual fingers</em> than to try and reconstruct any image from a stolen iPhone.</p>

      <p>This past week, my school has been on spring break. I&rsquo;ve been catching up on the news whenever I get a chance, but haven&rsquo;t had a chance to do much writing. Nonetheless, here are some of the more choice news stories you should check out, should you have missed them:</p>
<h3 id="the-xp-factor">The XP-Factor</h3>
<p>Peter Bright, in a recent article for <em>Wired</em>, shares that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/weeks-before-expiration-date-windows-xp-still-has-29-os-market-share/">Windows XP still has 29% of the total computer operating system share</a>. Not good news, considering that Microsoft will be dropping support for XP after April 8.</p>
<h3 id="time-magazine-website-redesign">Time Magazine Website Redesign</h3>
<p>Time Magazine has <a href="http://time.com">redesigned their website</a> to feature a more simple, clean layout. I&rsquo;m also a fan of the new &ldquo;Just Posted&rdquo; sidebar on the left.</p>
<h3 id="putt-putt-perfection">Putt-Putt Perfection</h3>
<p>Did you know there is a difference between putt-putt and miniature golf? The latter is what I&rsquo;ve been playing on summer nights for the past 15 years, but the former is a legitament form of competition — sans any clowns or windmill cutouts. Earlier this week, Grantland writer, David Jacoby, <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/putt-putt-perfection/">wrote up a great piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On April 9, 2011, at a tournament in Richmond, Virginia, an IT manager named Rick Baird notched 18 straight hole-in-one shots to record a perfect putt-putt score. In more than 50 years of sanctioned competition, it was just the third time that anyone had achieved the feat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="kant-brew-that">Kan&rsquo;t Brew That</h3>
<p>Interesting news for fans of the Kuerig coffee-brewing machine, manufactured by Green Mountain Coffee. Robinson Meyer for <em>The Atlantic</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Green Mountain Coffee has] historically operated on a razor blade model: Its Keurig business makes real money not by selling machine brewers but by selling K-Cups. Now cheaper competitors have moved in. They sell inexpensive one-off cups and reusable, extensible cups—threatening the company’s business on both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To help fight the reusable-cup market, the next version of Kuerig will <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/soon-our-robot-coffee-baristas-will-only-brew-certain-brands/284193/">only brew your coffee if an actual K-Cup is inserted</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flybook">FlyBook</h3>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> is reporting that Facebook is <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/now-facebook-has-a-drone-plan/">looking to acquire Titan Aerospace</a>, a drone manufacturer. Why would Facebook want drones? The most likely reason would be to help Zuckerberg further his recent efforts with <a href="http://internet.org">Internet.org</a>, which describes itself as &ldquo;a global partnership dedicated to making internet access available to the two thirds of the world not yet connected.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Spoken word &#34;Love&#34;</h2>
      <p>Had an interesting reflection experience.</p>
<p>I felt really inspired after watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bball1989">some of Jeff Bethke&rsquo;s videos</a>. I took this inspiration, along with my Macbook, and went to the BnB cafe. I grabbed a drink, sat down and took some quiet time to clear my mind. What I ended up doing was writing my first “spoken word” poetry piece. I really liked how it turned out, so I got creative and even <a href="http://youtu.be/ZPvXsyCDYs0">made a video</a> for it. It was a really great way for me to reflect; I felt in the zone and was really surprised at how refreshed I felt afterwards. Hopefully this is the start of something new for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstinence is hard / And no, that&rsquo;s not a pun / In fact the fight against temptation / Is the farthest thing from fun.</p>
<p>But He never puts us where / He&rsquo;s knows we can&rsquo;t succeed / Just don&rsquo;t try to fight alone / For only through Him are we freed.</p>
<p>True grace comes from devotion / We have the armor of our Lord / But if you close your heart and ignore His word / You&rsquo;ll fall on your own sword.</p>
<p>So guys, lead with grace / I know she feels like your life / But respect her how you&rsquo;d want another man / to respect your future wife.</p>
<p>Dear Lord keep us joyful / As we go our separate ways / May our minds remain on you / To give you ever-constant praise</p>
<p>Let us be bold for your message / You already paid the cost / Keep our convictions to you strong / When we&rsquo;re surrounded by the lost.</p>
<p>And let us lead them to you / To seek your mercy from above / For leading the lost to Jesus / Is the truest definition of love.</p>

      <h2>Svbtle and Medium</h2>
      <p>A couple days ago, Dustin Curtis <a href="http://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone">opened up registration</a> for his blogging platform, Svbtle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Svbtle is designed to highlight the things that matter; it&rsquo;s an extremely simple platform for collecting and developing ideas, sharing them with the world, and reading them. That&rsquo;s it. We&rsquo;ve focused all of our energy into designing the simplest interface possible for accomplishing these goals. Svbtle is blogging with everything else stripped away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Svbtle now joins <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> as a new place to write online, with the each service encouraging narratives that are longer than 140 characters.</p>
<p>However, Svbtle&rsquo;s public launch has stirred some conversation in the circles I follow. First, Nick Heer <a href="http://pxlnv.com/linklog/svbtle-open-for-everyone/">linked to the announcement</a>, but asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Svbtle and Medium are extraordinarily similar, and I&rsquo;m not sure I understand either of them. Are they user-generated publications? Are they like WordPress.com (as opposed to the .org package) but with a cooler interface?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following Heer&rsquo;s thoughts, writer &ldquo;The Typist&rdquo; <a href="http://thetypist.com/369/svbtle-vs-medium/">explained what he sees as the difference</a>. Regarding Svbtle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Svbtle is an online publishing platform: Like WordPress.com and Blogger and unlike Medium, it&rsquo;s decentralized, giving writers the option to have their own domain and logo, and though style customizations are limited to colors and avatars, Curtis explains in today&rsquo;s announcement that more options are to be presented soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From an earlier piece, Typist also argues that <a href="http://thetypist.com/329/medium-magazine/">Medium is really a magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One shouldn&rsquo;t compare Medium with services like WordPress.com because, while successfully touted as such, Medium isn&rsquo;t a service. It&rsquo;s a magazine. The only &ldquo;service&rdquo; in Medium is the service that (mostly) unpaid writers do in return for the potential exposure. Authors that have their own sub-page with a picture and a list of their articles is something online magazines have implemented back in the nineties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough conclusion.</p>
<p>But what are Svbtle and Medium <em>really</em> trying to be? Typist raises some good comparisons of the services but stops short of really getting at the principle difference between the two.</p>
<p>The <strong>primary</strong> difference between these two services is not how they let you host your content, the primary difference lies in how Svbtle and Medium approach identity.</p>
<h2 id="svbtles-me-vs-mediums-we">Svbtle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Me&rdquo; vs Medium&rsquo;s &ldquo;We&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Ironically, in the attempt to truly understand both these services, my International Politics class has come in handy. In IP, we studied how international leaders can estimate what the next move, plan, or capability of other world leaders is. Similar to world politics, in order to truly understand a company, it is important to look at both the history of that company&rsquo;s decisions <em>and</em> the profile of its leader. One without the other can lead to a rationalist&rsquo;s perspective, and skew our conclusions.</p>
<p>There are several ways to start, but the way I want to begin is by  profiling the perceived leader of each service (Svbtle : Dustin Curtis :: Medium : Ev Williams), and then analyze the history of decisions that each company has made. <em>Internetional Politics</em>, if you will.</p>
<p>Hold on, we are about to do a lot of digging (and TechCrunch linking).</p>
<p><em>Note: All the information I present is, or at one time was, publicly accessible information, and I present this research as purely that. Any conclusions I draw should not be taken as fact, but I will do my best to support any statements with as many applicable outside sources as possible.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-leaders">The Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Dustin Curtis</strong></p>
<p>Curtis is someone who is incredibly obsessed with his public persona. His trademarked logo is one he <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/17470103700">borrowed from The Flash</a>, and he puts much <a href="http://konigi.com/notebook/you-should-follow-me-twitter-dustin-curtis-experiments-call-action">effort into promoting himself under this image</a>.  Outside of his super hero logo and &ldquo;super hero&rdquo; moniker (we will come back to this), you would be hard-pressed to find anything on the internet that Curtis does not want you to find. To my knowledge, there is <a href="http://www.quora.com/Dustin-Curtis-1/Why-is-it-impossible-to-find-a-picture-of-Dustin-Curtis-on-the-internet">not a single photograph of him anywhere on the web</a>, yet he publicly posts <a href="http://life.dustincurtis.com">pictures from his day-to-day life</a>  (including shots <a href="http://life.dustincurtis.com/623571">of plane tickets</a>, <a href="http://life.dustincurtis.com/623582">his appartment</a> in California, and the <a href="http://life.dustincurtis.com/623580">food he is about to eat</a>). This irony is emblematic of the way Curtis approaches himself in many regards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Born <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/326593349735837696">April 23, 1987</a>.</li>
<li>Initial breakout into design &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; was with an unsolicited redesign of American Airlines.</li>
<li>Very <a href="http://www.quora.com/Dustin-Curtis-1/How-can-I-meet-Dustin-Curtis-in-San-Francisco/answer/Dustin-Curtis">open with meeting people in-person</a> and consistently <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/413911938356084737">polls his Twitter followers</a> regarding what there is to do in the cities he travels in.</li>
<li>Began schooling with the <a href="http://dcurt.is/facebook-timelines-and-lifepath-me-4">intention of becoming a doctor</a> (most likely in the <a href="http://www.quora.com/Has-any-research-been-done-on-the-application-of-principles-from-neuroscience-and-perception-to-the-design-of-user-interfaces">nueroscience</a> <a href="http://www.quora.com/Has-any-research-been-done-on-the-application-of-principles-from-neuroscience-and-perception-to-the-design-of-user-interfaces">field</a>).</li>
<li>Appears, to the public, to be <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/413069906075074560">slightly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/17529523287">narcisistic</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/22319978090">egotistical</a>, and incredibly opinioned.</li>
<li>Products built include Lifepath.me, a virtual timeline of one&rsquo;s life, and Svbtle. Potentially is the founder of the <a href="http://neutralcorporation.com/">Nuetral Corporation</a>, which is linked to from his <a href="http://dustincurtis.com">dustincurtis.com</a>, but no hard evidence supports this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Takeaway: identity, opinionated, design.</p>
<p><strong>Evan (Ev) Williams</strong></p>
<p>Our profile of Williams begins when he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/jobs/08bosses.html?_r=2&amp;">started, then dropped out, at the University of Nebraska</a>. Afterwards, Williams moved down to Florida to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB124000817787330413">do some copyediting, before moving to San Fransisco in 1996</a>. Williams is far less concerned about the division between his public image and the personal details of his life. Although the front page of his blog (<a href="http://evhead.com">evhead.com</a>) is blank, you can append the year to his URL and get his full archive of posts (try <a href="http://evhead.com/2005">/2005</a> and <a href="http://evhead.com/2010">/2010</a> as examples). From this, we can see his writing style is one of more casual nature than Curtis&rsquo;, and Williams often posted pictures of himself and the places he visited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Born <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_%28entrepreneur%29">March 31, 1972 (age 41)</a></li>
<li>Known primarily as <em>evhead</em> from <a href="http://evhead.com">his blog</a>, created in 1996.</li>
<li>Founded Blogger, <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804C&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R16795&amp;I=-3">invented terms &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; and &ldquo;blog&rdquo;</a> (thank heavens <a href="http://www.ajy.net/jmb/blogphenomenon.htm">the term &ldquo;bloggist&rdquo;</a> never caught on).</li>
<li>Co-Founded Odeo, a podcasting company, in 2004, after Blogger was acquired by Google.</li>
<li>Co-founded Twitter in April 2007</li>
<li>Co-Founded the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/obvious">Obvious Corp.</a>, a startup incubator and investment firm, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/the-obvious-corp-takes-backseat-as-ev-williams-biz-stone-and-jason-goldman-shift-focus-to-individual-startups/">run by the Twitter Co-Founders</a> .</li>
<li>Launched Medium in August 2012</li>
</ul>
<p>Takeaway: builder, primary concern is with the people using his products.</p>
<h3 id="history-of-applicable-events">History of Applicable Events</h3>
<p>Here, I have compiled a timeline of events that I see as important to assessing Svbtle, Medium, and their founders.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 16, 2003</strong>: Google <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/18/digitalmedia.citynews">acquires Pyra Labs, Williams&rsquo; company that built Blogger</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can get past the first sentence (&ldquo;Weblogs are going Googling.&quot;), there is some great background in this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030324075343/http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml">archived article from SilliconValley.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about this,&rdquo; said <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030324075343/http://www.evhead.com/">Evan Williams</a>, founder of Pyra, a company that has had its share of struggles. He wouldn&rsquo;t discuss terms of the deal, which he said was signed on Thursday, when we spoke Saturday. But  he did say it gives Pyra the &ldquo;resources to build on the vision I&rsquo;ve been working on for years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 2005</strong>: Williams <a href="http://evhead.com/2005/02/how-odeo-happened.asp">writes about his new startup</a>, Odeo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Williams outlined the goals of Odeo as follows (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odeo aims to enable this new distribution channel and medium by creating the best <strong>one-source solution for finding, subscribing to, and publishing</strong> audio content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fun aside: On September 20, 2010, Odeo hired Kevin Systrom as an intern. Systrom would later go on to become the Co-Founder of Instagram.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>July 15, 2006</strong>: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">Odeo launches Twttr</a>, the first iteration of the Twitter we know today. All status updates to the service are public.</li>
<li><strong>Oct 25, 2006</strong>: Odeo shuts down, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/10/25/odeo-rip-hello-obvious-corp/">relaunches as Obvious Corp.</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Williams&rsquo; <a href="http://evhead.com/2006/10/birth-of-obvious-corp_25.asp">personal post regarding the launch</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obvious is the company <strong>I&rsquo;ve wanted to start for a very long time—before Odeo and even at the beginning of Pyra Labs</strong>. It&rsquo;s great that both of those companies worked out the way they did. I learned some crucial stuff, and doing what I&rsquo;m doing now wouldn&rsquo;t have been as feasible before. But now I think the time is right.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oct 16, 2008</strong>: Williams assumes the role of Twitter CEO, after Jack Dorsey steps down.</li>
<li><strong>End of 2008</strong>: Curtis <a href="http://dcurt.is/facebook-timelines-and-lifepath-me-4">launches Lifepath.me</a>, a service that focuses on creating individual timelines of one&rsquo;s life. He later sells it for around $10,000 on eBay. The buyer <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/402559084135604224">paid in Bitcoin</a>.</li>
<li><strong>May 18th, 2009</strong>: Curtis does an <a href="http://www.flipthefunnelnow.com/dustin-curtis-%E2%80%93-dear-american-airlines/">unsolicited redesign of American Airlines (AA) website</a>, which garners a lot of attention after one of the user experience designers for AA <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/6531610/American-Airlines-worker-fired-for-replying-to-web-user-complaint.html">gets fired for responding to Curtis&rsquo; post</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Although all of Curtis&rsquo; old posts are <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/dear-american-airlines.html">removed from his website</a>, several years ago I, while learning how to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>, downloaded all his articles for later reference (they were well designed and informational); they have come in handy here. You can get a look at what his homepage used to looked like <a href="http://www.icyte.com/saved/dustincurtis.com/263943">here</a></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oct 4, 2010</strong>: Williams steps down from the Twitter CEO position, leaving it to, then COO, Dick Costolo.</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/04/twitter-ceo-dick-costolo/">Williams&rsquo; announcement that he was stepping down</a> and some reasoning why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am most satisfied while pushing product direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I argue that Williams was happy building Twitter, but the nature of Twitter&rsquo;s service being limited to 140-characters rubbed Williams the wrong way. He was a blogger, and tweeting is far more restrictive than blogging.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sep 29, 2011</strong>: Curtis&rsquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/119544652671098880">first tweet linking to his new blogging engine</a> (before it became Svbtle).</li>
<li><strong>Sep 2011</strong>: Williams reaches out to Teehan+Lax, a world renown digital design agency. Williams was looking to have Teehan+Lax design the interface and interaction for what would become Medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Teehan+Lax&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/story/medium/">blog post on building Medium</a>, an important quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it quickly became clear that egos played no role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Williams handing over design and direction to another company is exactly the opposite thing Curtis would have done when building a new product.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mar 22, 2012</strong>: Curtis first writes about his new blogging engine in &ldquo;<a href="http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle">Codename: Svbtle</a>&quot;. Svbtle opens as an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/23/2897027/svbtle-dustin-curtis-obtvse-clone-open-source">invite-only network</a>. The clean design attracts a lot of attention, particularly one small element called the Kudos button; a hover-to-activate way of &ldquo;liking&rdquo; any page on Svbtle. Curtis <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/164080493384577025">likes it</a> and <a href="http://dcurt.is/unkudo">defends the button</a>, calling it an &ldquo;otherwise meaningless number&rdquo;. The Kudos button is symbolic of Curtis himself, anonymous yet extremely identifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curtis on <a href="http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle">the design of Svbtle</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is simple: when you see the Svbtle design, <strong>you should know that the content is guaranteed to be great</strong>. Network bloggers are encouraged to keep quality high at the expense of everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apr 2, 2012</strong>: Curtis stops using the moniker &ldquo;<a href="http://about.me/dcurtis">Superhero</a>&rdquo; and opts for &ldquo;Villain.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="http://dcurt.is/villainy">the post on Villainy</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as long as villains can hold themselves back from corruption, they can do great things. Villains must be strong. A villain&rsquo;s only responsibility is to <strong>protect what he symbolizes</strong>. In the absence of a responsibility to the public, a villain must fight against his primal instincts.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aug 14, 2012</strong>: Medium <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2012/08/14/twitter-founders-preview-new-online-publishing-medium/">launches in invite-only mode as well</a>. Users can sign up via their Twitter handles and &ldquo;recommend&rdquo; stories, but not yet write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jan 8, 2013</strong>: Svbtle receives a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/08/with-funding-for-svbtle-dustin-curtis-wants-to-build-a-business-in-long-form-online-content/">&ldquo;not insignificant&rdquo; amount of seed funding</a>. Curtis empasizes that the money is for building infrastrucutre, build great writing tools, and provide a cushion for experimentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mar 2013</strong>: Around this time, Curtis <a href="http://www.quora.com/Dustin-Curtis-1/What-happened-to-the-articles-at-Dustincurtis-com/answer/Dustin-Curtis">removes all his old articles from dustincurtis.com</a> and commits to using <a href="http://dcurt.is">dcurt.is</a>, which matches his Twitter username, <a href="http://twitter.com/dcurtis">@dcurtis</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 4, 2013</strong>: Medium redesigns with, what they call, &ldquo;Medium 1.0,&rdquo; featuring full-bleed images, and an improved &ldquo;read this next&rdquo; link at the bottom of every piece. Svbtle has a similar feature, but Medium&rsquo;s &ldquo;next&rdquo; piece is rarely one from the same author, Svbtle&rsquo;s always is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jan 28, 2014</strong>: Svbtle <a href="http://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone">opens to the public</a>. On the same day,  Medium announces it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/blogging-platform-medium-reportedly-closes-25m-round-led-by-greylock/">has raised $25 million</a> in Series A funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analyzing">Analyzing</h3>
<p>Curtis is, and will continue to be, obsessed with idea of a public identity, masking his private life. To him, being a villain means that &ldquo;Unlike superheroes, villains are not beholden to the requirements of their position.&rdquo; Before he removed all the content on dustincurtis.com, each article featured a completely custom design, font selection, and layout. Curtis cares <em>immensely</em> about controlling the way he is presented.</p>
<p>So it was that when he built Svbtle, he vitriolically defended its design when <a href="http://howells.ws/posts/view/93/svbtle-vs-obtvse-and-on-copying">the blog theme copies started showing up</a>.</p>
<p>Later, as the design of Svbtle matured, it was ostensible that Curtis remained the single designer and has never handed creative direction to anyone else. Curtis wants to build a way of epitomizing a person&rsquo;s identity, under the directive of what he sees as best. When an author uses Svbtle, the only thing that should say &ldquo;Svbtle&rdquo; is the layout design. The site even explicitly  discourages from putting the word &ldquo;svbtle&rdquo; anywhere in a custom domain. From the settings page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;Svbtle&rdquo; in your domain; for example, use &ldquo;blog.yourdomain.com&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;svbtle.yourdomain.com&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Svbtle blog and the content is you, but the design is Curtis.</p>
<p>Medium, on the other hand, focuses on design for a single reason: the benefit of the content.</p>
<p>In many ways, I think a part of Williams never left that small apartment in California where he was building Blogger. Williams is a creator at heart, and one who focuses on creating tools for people to express the multiple dimensions of their existence. Medium&rsquo;s flexibility in presentation (allowing it to be used as a <a href="https://medium.com/photo-narrative/c7d422e3ebee">photo blog</a>, or simply list the <a href="https://medium.com/top-100/">top 100 posts</a> from around the Medium network) allow it to be anything for anyone. Looking from Blogger to Odeo to Twitter and, now, to Medium, it is clear that Williams wants to build networks where the users contribute <em>to the network</em>, not themselves.</p>
<p>The quote from Williams&rsquo; thoughts on launching Obvious Corp. are particularly poignant when in juxtaposition with Medium:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obvious is the company I&rsquo;ve wanted to start for a very long time—before Odeo and even at the beginning of Pyra Labs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Medium, I wager, is very much the matured vision of what Williams wanted for Blogger and, to an extent, Odeo. Had Twitter not become popular, I think we would have seen something like Medium a lot sooner than we did; Williams wants to build a network where <em>who</em> you are does not matter so much as <em>what</em> you create. Medium takes the responsibility of being &ldquo;someone&rdquo; off your shoulders.</p>
<p>A visitor could read 100 articles on Medium and possibly come away without being able to recall which author wrote a particular piece. A visitor to Svbtle knows exactly whose words they are reading.</p>
<p>Curtis built Svbtle from a deep desire for a unique blend of anonymity and marketed identity. Williams built Medium to facilitate the surfacing of great content, without putting pressure on the author to &ldquo;be&rdquo; anyone. Both services have done incredible things to the web publishing game, but the place to start drawing lines between the two is fundamentally based on how both founders approach identity.</p>
<p>Svbtle will continue to focus on the author and personal brand.</p>
<p>Medium will continue to focus on the craft and surfacing stories from anyone.</p>
<p>Just like their leaders would.</p>

      <h2>Swiss Army</h2>
      <p>I love Swiss Army knives. When I was a kid, I had a red-handled one that had all the essential things a boy on a small farm needed. I used to spend hours whittling away at sticks, or tightening up the screws on my toys and bike. More than once, the tweezers were brought out to get a microscopic splinter out of my palm. I used the heck out of that thing and it always found a place in my pocket.</p>
<p>Then one day, when I was 14, I misplaced it. To this day I haven&rsquo;t been able to find it. I later received a small, camo-clad hunting knife for Christmas from our family friends. It served my purposes for the time, but I still missed the versatility of my old knife.</p>
<p>Yesterday as I was browsing Amazon, I saw that they had a sale going on - Take $10 off your Swiss Army knife purchase! - and I took that as a sign. After searching the models, I decided on the <a href="http://amzn.com/B0007QCOB0">&ldquo;Tinker&rdquo;</a>. I like the small number of tools and that it comes in a black paint. I&rsquo;m expecting it to arrive sometime today, it will be great to have an old friend back in my bag.</p>

      <h2>Sync Google Fonts to Your Desktop</h2>
      <p>Fonts.com has put together a pretty cool new service, dubbed SkyFonts, that lets you <a href="http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts/google">sync any of Google Fonts&rsquo; 1,173 typefaces to your computer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are proud to have teamed up with Google to offer desktop versions of their popular Google Fonts free of charge. Offered for use in print, these fonts are delivered using SkyFont’s patent-pending font delivery technology and can be used anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each time a font is updated — such as when new characters are added — SkyFonts will automatically update the font on your device. Syncing Google Fonts with SkyFonts will also improve your web browsing experience, by cutting the time spent downloading fonts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They offer apps for both OS X and Windows, and you can download individual weights of a particular font or batch-install the top-50 most popular families.</p>
<p>Although the app interface is a little cumbersome (you have to use Fonts.com&rsquo;s interface to queue files for download), the service makes it extremely conveineint to get access to a huge library of decent fonts for free. If you have ever searched for fonts online, you know how ad-filled and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_bait">link bait</a>-ridden those download pages can be; SkyFonts is a nice alternative.</p>
<p>My one question for SkyFonts is: how do they know which computer to send the fonts I queue? I never registered for an account; I just downloaded the app, and it worked. They could be cross-matching IP addresses, between the app and the browser, but that would be an unconventional way of going about it. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything on the site, except that Fonts.com calls the method a &ldquo;patent-pending font delivery technology.&rdquo; Interesting.</p>

      <h2>Synthesis: Apple Acquires Beats Music and Beats Electronics</h2>
      <p>Planning to close the deal later this year, Apple will pay $3 billion to acquire Beats Music and Beats Electronics. Beats co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will also be joining Apple as employees.</p>
<p>Straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth, via <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/05/28Apple-to-Acquire-Beats-Music-Beats-Electronics.html">Apple PR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Music is such an important part of Apple’s DNA and always will be,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “The addition of Beats will make our music lineup even better, from free streaming with iTunes Radio to a world-class subscription service in Beats, and of course buying music from the iTunes Store as customers have loved to do for years.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the Beats brand will remain an independent entity, unlike other acquisitions, which have been folded into the Apple brand. Peter Kafka <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/28/meet-apples-latest-hire-and-apples-media-boss-jimmy-iovine-and-eddy-cue-come-to-code-liveblog/">reporting for <em>Re/code</em></a> has more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple says the deal will close by the end of its fiscal year, which means by the end of September. It says the deal will be accretive [read: counted] in its next fiscal year. But Cook says the economics of the deal are secondary to the potential it generates for Apple’s roadmap: “The instant that this deal is approved, we can begin working on the future together. And I believe that that future is better than anything either company could build on its own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever someone says the &ldquo;Apple roadmap,&rdquo; most of the time they mean Apple&rsquo;s plans for new &ldquo;hardware.&rdquo; However, despite the Beats headphones being a major status symbol, <a href="https://medium.com/five-hundred-words/apple-eats-beats-54707d4a2f73">MG Siegler points out</a> that this deal is probably more about the Beats Music streaming service and Mr. Iovine&rsquo;s talents and connections:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The streaming service, Beats Music, is mentioned before the better-known Beats Electronics branch. That, mixed with some of the <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/28/tim-cook-explains-why-apple-is-buying-beats-qa/">other comments from Tim Cook</a> suggest that this deal is first and foremost about Beats Music. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Dre is a nice “get” as well, given his deep history in music and the credibility he’ll also provide Apple in the space (both amongst fans and peers). But this is mainly about Iovine, who has long stood beside Apple in digital music and now will work under Cue, undoubtedly helping to further bridge the gap between Apple and the entertainment industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound accurate to me. Besides, buying an iconic, <a href="https://www.beatsmusic.com/about/editorial">expertly curated</a>, and social music streaming business is a much better idea than attempting any sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Ping">Ping 2.0</a> comeback. Historically, Apple is not good at web-driven services, so buying a product with established (web) success is worth every billion.</p>
<p>Finally, Mark Gurman, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/28/tim-cooks-memo-to-employees-on-beats-buy-i-hope-you-are-as-excited-as-i-am-about-this-new-chapter-in-our-history/">writing for 9to5Mac</a>, has a letter to Apple employees from Tim Cook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beats Music was built with deep respect for both artists and fans. We think it’s the first subscription service to really get it right. Both Apple and Beats believe that a great music service requires a strong editorial and curation team, and we will continue to expand what we do in those areas. The addition of Beats will make our incredible iTunes lineup even better, extending the emotional connection our customers have with music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admitting that Beats Music is the first to &ldquo;get it right&rdquo; is high praise from Apple, especially considering they have a player in the game with iTunes Radio. That, if anything, is a big indication as to how excited Apple is that this deal is happening.</p>
<h3 id="my-questions">My questions</h3>
<p>Apple currently sells Beats headphones in most (all?) of its Apple Stores. Will these products get priority placement, marketing, and employee attention now?</p>
<p>The HTC One, HTC&rsquo;s flagship smartphone, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_One_%282013%29%23Hardware">featured Beats Audio</a> software in the company&rsquo;s 2013 (M7) model but not the 2014 (M8) one. Was this because the Apple-Beats deal was ongoing? What about future Apple devices that tout &ldquo;Beats&rdquo; hardware or software?</p>
<p>Back in April, Beats Music started [using Apple&rsquo;s in-app purchase dialogue to sell subscriptions]({% post_url 2014-04-21-beats-in-app %}), giving Apple a 30% cut of the profits. To what extent (if any) did the negotiations have on the decision-making at Beats Music? I imagine it would be much easier to give Apple a 1/3 cut of your profits, when it looks like they&rsquo;ll own you in a month or two anyways.</p>

      <h2>Tapbots and iOS 7</h2>
      <p>When iOS 7 was announced, it instantly made most of the apps in the App Store look old and outdated; apps that had previously made heavy use of graphics and images looked out of place in contrast to iOS 7&rsquo;s flatness.</p>
<p>One of my favorite app developer teams, <a href="http://tapbots.com">Tapbots</a>, was hit particularly hard by the iOS 7 announcement. Over the past several years, the Tapbots team, Mark Jardine (design) and Paul Haddad (code), had built a company by designing highly-customized user interfaces for their applications. I was curious how they&rsquo;d respond to the changes.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.macworld.com/video/26841/paul-haddad-on-tweetbot-and-calcbot.html">interview with <em>Macworld</em></a> following the announcement of iOS 7 at Apple&rsquo;s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), Haddad made the following comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have to match exactly what&rsquo;s there [in iOS 7], but we definitely have to take some of the cues that, you know, they&rsquo;re giving us.
[&hellip;]
Today might kind of throw everything up in the air, because we&rsquo;ll have to go back and look at how much we&rsquo;re going to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By far, Tapbots most popular app is Tweetbot; a powerful Twitter client that lets you easily manage multiple accounts, view conversation threads, and is also my personal favorite . After WWDC, Tapbots had remained particularly quiet about any progress, and Tweetbot was looking older with every passing day. However, this past Thursday, Jardine gave an <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/business/tapbots-and-the-state-of-our-apps-in-ios7">update on the company blog</a> regarding the past few months:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Playing with the beta of iOS7 over the next few weeks brought us to the realization that this would not just be a &ldquo;re-skin&rdquo;. We really had to just start over with the new foundation and concepts of iOS7.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working night and day for the last 4 months to re-design and develop an app [Tweetbot] that took over a year to build. The good news is that we are extremely happy with the results and can&rsquo;t wait to share it with everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Jardine, Tweetbot 3 has been submitted to the App Store and is awaiting approval. Like I&rsquo;ve said before, [great software takes time]({% post_url 2013-10-02-paying-for-software %}), and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Tapbots has spent the last four months building.</p>

      <h2>Text files</h2>
      <p>Text files are one of those things that will never go away. They are organic to the computer world and are supported by every operating system. However, many people don&rsquo;t take advantage of the awesome powers that text files hold. Here is my quick and simple guide to start implementing a little more text into your lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="open-up-an-editor">Open up an editor</h3>
<p>One the Mac? Use TextEdit in plain text mode. On the PC? Use Notepad or similar. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter which text editor you end up using (note: Microsoft Word is <em>not</em> a viable option for what we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish), what matters is that the application is as minimal as possible so you can focus on the content, not the window chrome.</p>
<h3 id="put-the-date-in-the-file-name">Put the date in the file name</h3>
<p>Use the scheme YYYY/MM/DD at the beginning or somewhere in your text file name. That way, you&rsquo;re only a quick name-sort or query away from finding the file you want.</p>
<h3 id="make-lots">Make lots</h3>
<p>Have a todo list? Make a todo.txt. Have a draft of a blog post? Keep it in a my-awesome-draft.txt. Don&rsquo;t overburden one text file with ALL of your information. Even thought it could handle the job, and some people prefer having one text file to rule them all, I find it is much easier to find and organize into folders my text files if they are separates beings.</p>
<h3 id="have-a-capture-all-mentality">Have a capture-all mentality</h3>
<p>Keep one text file for those quick little blurbs of information you get throughout the day that you need to remember. Whether it be a quote, a movie you see a trailer for you like, or anything, throw it in that text file. You&rsquo;ll always be able to go back and delete things you remembered or don&rsquo;t feel are important anymore, but you&rsquo;ll never be able to add back that one thing you can&rsquo;t remember at the end of the day.</p>
<h3 id="do-it">Do it</h3>
<p>Writing in text files is a weird thing to do if you&rsquo;ve never gotten into the practice of it before. Keep at it. Once you get use to having a million of little files all organized by folders, you will achieve a sense of peace and organization that, for me, is unmatched by any other application on your computer.</p>
<p>Love the text files and they will love you.</p>

      <h2>TextEdit</h2>
      <p>Can we take a moment to thank the folks at Apple for TextEdit? I&rsquo;m serious. There is no shortage of text editors for OS X, yet I find myself continually coming back to TextEdit. It&rsquo;s fast, simple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/TextEdit/Introduction/Intro.html">open source</a> [1], and every Mac has a copy preinstalled. Pick out a nice monospaced font, and I think you have a challenger for even the most minimalistic of writing interfaces.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s OS X apps tend get a lot of criticism, but after 10 years and tens of thousands of words, I have yet to have a major issue with TextEdit. For getting thoughts to screen, it just works, and I think that deserves some public praise.</p>

<p>Read that again. A company opted-in a customer to a program that costs over $1,500 a year, and they only informed him after the deed was done.</p>

      <h2>The Amazon Smartphone</h2>
      <p>Zach Epstein, writing for BGR (yup, [that BGR]({% post_url 2013-10-19-foolish-bgr %})):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main rear camera is thought to feature a resolution of 13 megapixels, and the phone also includes a standard front-facing camera for video chats as well as Amazon’s Mayday customer service feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond those two units, the device houses an additional four front-facing cameras that work with other sensors to facilitate the software’s 3D effects. One source tells us these four cameras, which are situated in each of the four corners on the face of the phone, are low-power infrared cameras.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The device’s extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true, this is a great scoop, and color me interested. But using &ldquo;3D&rdquo; as a feature feels like a gimmick. 3D TV is <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2014/01/3d-tv-dead/356721/">practically</a> <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/samsung-admits-3d-tv-demand-underwhelming-13222753/">dead</a>, and the paralax effect in iOS 7, which <a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-7-and-motion-sickness-poll">gave users motions sickness</a>, was demoted to a toggle switch in the 7.1 update.</p>
<p>A much more interesting feature is going to be how deeply Amazon integrates its services and online store into the device. Think [Amazon Dash]({% post_url 2014-04-09-amazon-dash %}), but built into your smartphone. Huge potential here.</p>

      <h2>The Billionaire&#39;s Typewriter</h2>
      <p>Matthew Butterick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But by the end, I re­al­ized I dis­agree deeply with Medium about the ethics of de­sign. And by ethics, I mean some­thing sim­ple: though Medium and I are both mak­ing tools for writ­ers, what I want for writ­ers and what Medium wants couldn’t be more dif­fer­ent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In truth, Medium’s main prod­uct is not a pub­lish­ing plat­form, but the pro­mo­tion of a pub­lish­ing plat­form. This pro­mo­tion brings read­ers and writ­ers onto the site. This, in turn, gen­er­ates the us­age data that’s valu­able to ad­ver­tis­ers. Boiled down, Medium is sim­ply mar­ket­ing in the ser­vice of more mar­ket­ing. It is not a “place for ideas.” It is a place for ad­ver­tis­ers. It is, there­fore, ut­terly superfluous.</p>

      <h2>The Bullet Journal Note-Taking System</h2>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you love taking notes by hand. <a href="http://www.bulletjournal.com">The Bullet Journal</a>, developed by art director and designer Ryder Carroll, is a note-taking system that focuses on helping quickly collect and find all your daily todos and notes. I&rsquo;ve been using it for the past few months and have found it to be a very personal, elegant way of organizing my daily life.</p>
<p>The primary place I&rsquo;ve started using it is with my school notebooks. Numbering every page and keeping an index at the beginning of each notebook has fundamentally changed the way I take class notes. Four weeks into the semester, I&rsquo;m more organized now than I&rsquo;ve ever been before in past years. Essentially, it helps your notes become more organized over time, not less.</p>

<p>If you are the sort of person who appreciates nice paper, a decent pen, a well-crafted notebook, a solid pencil, writing and receiving handwritten correspondence, beautiful handwriting, or the clicky-clack of a dependable typewriter, you have come to the right place. The Cramped is a site dedicated to the pleasures of writing with analog tools (the name is purposefully ironic).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Same great build, smaller package. However, based on [my own experience with the GR1]({% post_url 2013-09-09-my-gear %}) (I&rsquo;m 5-8), I&rsquo;d recommend the following:</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 5-7 and under, definitely a GR0. For everyone else, it depends on how much you want to fit in the bag. I&rsquo;ve been able to pack three-days worth of clothing into my GR1, but for those who don&rsquo;t need the extra space, a GR0 looks perfect.</p>

      <p><strong>Notes on spoilers:</strong> <em>Although my comments and pull-quotes below are spolier-free, the Guardian&rsquo;s review reveals a number of plot details for Firewatch. If you want to go into the game completely fresh, save the full piece for later this week.</em></p>
<p>The Guardian&rsquo;s Nathan Ditum, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/firewatch-review-first-person-simulation-adventure-game">in his review</a> of <em>Firewatch</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writing is not just believable, it is likeable and funny. Henry and Delilah’s exchanges are full of the familiar tug and tarry of people getting to know each other, of playing and of flirting, and of reaching out to feel less alone. Henry’s sadsack dryness – by turns curt, dopey and earnest – isn’t just endearing, it’s endearingly realistic. His words sound like something we might say, which makes the dialogue choices the game offers all the more effective. It’s a matter of investment, even if we’re not deciding anything crucial, we buy it. We’re in.</p>

      <h2>The Hidden Beauty of Airport Runways</h2>
      <p>Fascinating article on the work of Lauren O’Neil, a Brooklyn-based designer who uses Google Earth to capture images of airport runway layouts. Joseph Flaherty, writing for <em>WIRED</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.laurenoneilldesign.com/">O&rsquo;Neil</a> turns those strictures [airport runways] into art, with the help of Google Earth. The Brooklyn-based designer has made a meticulous study of airport runways and logged the results on a Tumblr called <em><a href="http://holding-pattern.tumblr.com">Holding Pattern</a></em>. These views reveal beautiful compositions at airports that are nothing special at ground level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I especially enjoyed the section regarding runway typography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Airports use a specialized font to number their runways. It’s highly geometric, which eliminates confusing curves and can be reduced to simple schematics, making it easy for groundskeepers lacking typographic training to recreate. The font apparently has no name, but the numbers are called “runway designators” in pilot parlance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had you shown this font to me, out of context, I may have laughed at you. A good reminder that &ldquo;design&rdquo; can take many forms, but the best designs are always at the intersection of real-world use and user context.</p>

      <p>A roundtable on filmmaking, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7qKKQrSBY">with the filmmakers</a>. Scott is incredibly measured, Tarantino is quintessentially eccentric, and I enjoyed whenever the discussion turned to them talking about their own writing.</p>

      <h2>The Ikea bookbook</h2>
      <p>Ikea, six days before Apple&rsquo;s September event, released a clever, short video, introducing the Ikea bookbook. From the video description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At only 8mm thin, and weighing in at less than 400g, the 2015 IKEA Catalogue comes pre-installed with thousands of home furnishing ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun, and in good taste.</p>
<p>To be fair, the iPhone 6 and 6+ <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/">are thinner</a> than the bookbook; however, not even Apple&rsquo;s best can beat that bookbook&rsquo;s battery life and built-in security features.</p>

      <h2>The Importance of Journaling</h2>
      <p>Richard Holmes always gave us ice cream. Whenever my siblings and I would walk down the road to say hello, the first thing he&rsquo;d do would be to tell us there&rsquo;s &ldquo;ice cream in the back.&rdquo; Although he was just a neighbor who lived down the road, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he never actually ate any of the ice cream he bought for us. It was just something he did for our benefit.</p>
<p>Surrounded by corn in a small farmhouse about a half-mile off the road, we&rsquo;d sit in his front living room and gaze out the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the front yard. He&rsquo;d tell us stories about the war, growing up during the Great Depression, and how he had saved up enough money to buy his first, and only, house in full. My favorites were the ones where he&rsquo;d talk about his life around the age of 25. He sounded like the type of guy you wished you had as a friend. Adventurous, smart and a good soul.</p>
<p>However, for all his stories, Mr. Holmes didn&rsquo;t have many tangible items to go along with them. I don&rsquo;t blame him for not having them — he had grown up without them after all — but hearing his stories just made it more intoxicating to imagine what he was like before disease and years of rigorous work had taken him off a tractor and put a cane in his hand. Aside from a few stoic photographs from his time in the army, the young Richard was left to my imagination.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I first began designing, I kept a copy of everything I made. This was partly out of necessity — never sure if I could recreate any given design; it was safer just to duplicate a project folder. Eventually this habit began to permeate into other areas of my life, most notably when it came to keeping a journal.</p>
<p>I started with a simple notebook from the dollar store and a pen I didn&rsquo;t loath the way ink flowed out. My thoughts weren&rsquo;t profound; sometimes they had less substance than a tweet, but I continued to write day after day. Not only was I experiencing growth in areas of my life, but I also became acutely aware of how much I had grown over time. Reading back through the emotions of nervousness as I was entering college are almost laughable now that I&rsquo;m almost through. Laughable in a, don&rsquo;t-I-know-myself kind of way.</p>
<p>Today, journaling is integral to my life. It is a time for me to step back into my own little world and discuss things with myself. It sounds silly, but the stress that can melt away simply by writing out your thoughts is incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>I feel that journaling is even more important for me now than when I started. As we&rsquo;ve seen the meteoric rise of social sharing, I think we lose the incentive to go back into our memories and write down the events from our own point of view. We compensate with pictures and videos and assume those will be enough. There&rsquo;s nothing bad about browsing through our Facebook albums to relive a memory, but in every situation I&rsquo;ve wanted to go relive an event it&rsquo;s the journal entry I wrote for that day which evokes more emotion and sentimental feelings than any other media.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr. Holmes passed away before I finished my freshmen year of college. It was one of the saddest days I&rsquo;ve ever experienced, and when we removed his beaten-up maroon reclining chair it felt like all the happiness had dried up from the world.</p>
<p>When I got back to college later that day, I went through some of my old entries looking for bits and pieces to remember, and they were there. The time he taught me how to drive stick-shift. The time he told us about the small litter of puppies they had on his base. The time he got his first job and met his wife. They were all there. The stories live on, written with the enthusiasm of a boy who had just been told a most wonderful adventure.</p>
<hr>
<p>I often think about how my grandchildren will one day be able to go back through years of data my life has generated online and off. High definition videos, years of blog posts, with tweets and Facebook to fill in the gaps. Perhaps they won&rsquo;t care, but I can&rsquo;t even imagine what it would have been like to actually see Mr. Holmes when he was a young man. Maybe the fact that the future generation will be able to see us as young people will help remind them that everyone was at one point in time.</p>
<p>But even if Mr. Holmes had all those pictures and videos, I don&rsquo;t think it would have changed how I wrote about him. It would have been a luxury, but not a necessity to truly understanding the type of man he was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for this reason I encourage you to start writing today. Get a 3-subject notebook, open a text file, date the top and start writing. If you&rsquo;re going to invest in documenting your memories, you owe it to yourself try doing it in your own words. Because no matter how many gigabytes of data you produce over your lifetime, none of it will ever be able to capture you better than you. If not for your benefit, then maybe for someone else&rsquo;s. I often look forward to the day when I can hand my son an edited version of my years as a teen. See, kid? I went through this stuff too. In fact, some of these entries were written specifically with you in mind. Nobody&rsquo;s perfect, but what&rsquo;s important is to capture the story that accompanies imperfection — that&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;ll love rereading the most.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr. Holmes never spoke of a journal, but I secretly hoped I might find something as we cleaned out his house for the last time. I never came across such a memoir, but I take solace in knowing that I&rsquo;ve helped preserve at least a few of his stories; if only to aid me as I retell them to my own children. And, I&rsquo;m sure, every now and again they&rsquo;ll get a little ice cream with story time.</p>

      <h2>The Kinsa Thermometer</h2>
      <p>These past few days I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledregercom/status/398851532848132096">been sick with a cold</a>. When ill, one of the things I always do is keep a diligent hand-written journal of any medication I took and all the corresponding times. I&rsquo;ve often thought about building a simple app to manage this for me, but Inder Singh, the executive vice president of the Clinton Health Access from 2008 to 2011, looks to be taking this idea one step further with, what he calls, the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Smartest Thermometer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret Rhodes <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3020201/innovation-by-design/this-tech-enabled-thermometer-tracks-more-than-just-a-fever">writing about Kinsa for <em>Fast Company</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks and functions like a basic thermometer; the difference is on the back end. The device plugs into an iPhone&rsquo;s headphone jack, so instead of waiting for a beep and a digit for the results, Kinsa shows the degree-by-degree rise in temperature on the phone&rsquo;s screen. This is where a normal thermometer stops&ndash;you either have a fever or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kinsa keeps going, connecting users with what Singh calls the &ldquo;health weather.&rdquo; Is the flu going around your neighborhood? Are kids at your child&rsquo;s school passing around strep throat? Who&rsquo;s down with the chicken pox? Kinsa wants to provide that context, with the aim of preventing unnecessary and costly trips to the doctor along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s exciting. I initially wasn&rsquo;t thrilled with the way the <a href="http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2013/10/3020201-inline-th-pkg-520fuc.png">Kinsa thermometer looked</a>, but if you actually raise your phone to your mouth, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s not an uncomfortable position to hold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no price announced yet, but with the range for household thermometers being anywhere from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3764261">$6 to around $50</a>, it will be interesting to see what Kinsa decide as a price point and if they will charge for the app as well.</p>

      <h2>The Legend of &#34;Open&#34;</h2>
      <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer not to use the generally used term &lsquo;open world&rsquo; when developing software, but we used this term [at E3] in order to make it easier for consumers to understand. This term means that there is a large world in which players can do numerous things daily.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s Shigeru Miyamoto at Nintendo&rsquo;s latest shareholders meeting, reported on by Lucy O&rsquo;Brien, for IGN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this said, Miyamoto does not hesitate to call  Zelda&rsquo;s new world  &ldquo;vast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Open world&rdquo; might be one of the most tortured terms in gaming today. I&rsquo;m not crazy about &ldquo;vast,&rdquo; but good on Nintendo for attempting to draw a distinction. In fact, I&rsquo;m glad they did; an open world Zelda title wouldn&rsquo;t be a Zelda title.</p>

      <h2>The Log Podcast</h2>
      <p>Last night, I flipped the switch on my latest project, <a href="/log">The Log Podcast</a> [1].</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t tell you just <em>how</em> excited I am to launch this. Not only has daily readership of the site reached a point where I&rsquo;m comfortable to start branching out into different mediums, but I now have a way of reaching my readers through a medium I have a great passion for: public speaking. For the past few months I had been working out the logistics of getting a podcast up and running, and finally being able to get something out there feels great.</p>
<p>Instead of writing too much more about the show, I would recommend you go listen to the pilot episode. Although my audio occasionally gets a little high (I was excited), the following episodes should fix that issue. Once you&rsquo;ve finished, please do not hesitate to <a href="/colophon">let me know</a> what you think.</p>
<p>Thank you for being with me on the journey so far, and here&rsquo;s to another chapter.</p>

      <h2>The Mac Keeps Going</h2>
      <p>After returning from Christmas break, I noticed a lot of students carrying around Microsoft Surface tablets. I see these devices in meetings, in class, and anywhere there is a surface (ha) to put them. What I have yet to see, however, is anyone using the Surface exclusively as a tablet.</p>
<p>I have had the chance to use these devices, and they are good laptops if you like Windows, but they are not good tablets. They&rsquo;re heavy (comparatively), Windows 8 is still sketchy to use without a mouse, and the stylus is, well, another thing you have to keep track of.</p>
<p>The Surface is first and foremost a laptop. Regardless the convergence of Windows 8 with a touchscreen, the Surface does not, to me, represent a better product than two separate devices, designed specifically for each type of product category.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday, three of Apple&rsquo;s executive team — Phillip Schiller, Bud Tribble, and Craig Federighi — sat down with <em>MacWorld&rsquo;s</em> Jason Snell <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2090829/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html">for an interview on the past 30 years of the Macintosh</a>.</p>
<p>As I read, it only became clearer that the Mac is, and will forever be, a separate product, with its own strengths that add to the Apple lineup.</p>
<p>Federighi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s obvious and easy enough to slap a touchscreen on a piece of hardware, but is that a good experience? We believe, no.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schiller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not an either/or. It’s a world where you’re going to have a phone, a tablet, a computer, you don’t have to choose. And so what’s more important is how you seamlessly move between them all … it’s not like this is a laptop person and that’s a tablet person. It doesn’t have to be that way.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple clearly sees a strength, and differentiation from the competition, by offering different devices for different types of uses. They want users to choose the best tool for the job, instead of being forced to use one product for everything.</p>

      <h2>The New iPads</h2>
      <p>Apple&rsquo;s got two new iPads out, and I finally got to play with both of them this past weekend at my local Apple Store. Here are my thoughts after about 10 minutes with each device.</p>
<p><em>Note: For this post, I&rsquo;ll be shortening both iPad names to just &ldquo;Air&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retina Mini.&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="lighter-than-air">Lighter than Air</h3>
<p>The first thing you notice about the Air is what&rsquo;s not there. At just 1 pound (1.05 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), Apple has cut nearly a half-pound of weight from the previous generation. The bezel has been trimmed down as well, making it look much more in line with the aesthetics of the Retina Mini.</p>
<p>Being used to a 4th generation iPad, picking up the Air felt like I had just witnessed a magic trick. My brain <em>thought</em> the amount of force needed to lift the device was much more than was actually required. It&rsquo;s the kind of change in weight that can completely alter how one would conceivably use the product. For instance, the reduced weight drastically helps better position the Air as a reading device; one you wouldn&rsquo;t mind holding with a single hand for an hour or so.</p>
<p>The new hardware feels sublime to hold, and I feel Apple has now reached a design in parity with the Retina Mini; a design they&rsquo;ll stick with for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="seeing-clearly">Seeing clearly</h3>
<p>Although the Air is a great improvement on the previous generation, the new Retina Mini is, in my opinion, the perfect iPad.</p>
<p>Although nothing has changed in regards to form or weight, the addition of a Retina Display has completely changed the game. Photos, app icons, and — most importantly — text now look crisp and sharp. If you come from any other Retina devices (iPhone 4 and up), your eyes will no longer burn with the pain that is looking at a lower-resolution display.</p>
<p>Other than the Retina Display, there are no visible changes to the hardware design. The only <em>actual</em> change is an increase in thickness of about 0.3mm, but it&rsquo;s impossible to notice unless you inspect the previous generation and the Retina Mini side-by-side.</p>
<p>The original iPad Mini was a winner and, for me, the iPad that Apple always wanted to build. With the new Retina Display and internal specs to match that of the Air, Apple is now, essentially, selling one iPad, but in two different sizes.</p>
<h3 id="ios-7-and-touch-id">iOS 7 and Touch ID</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, iOS 7 still has some work to do before it&rsquo;s really ready for the big screen. In my brief tests, there were some noticeable instances where transitions acted weirdly, particularly with the parallax effect on the home screen wallpaper. I&rsquo;m sure these things will be ironed out in future updates, but it&rsquo;s still slightly disappointing that the iOS experience isn&rsquo;t as great for the iPad as it is on the iPhone.</p>
<p>An omission, if you can even call it that, from this year&rsquo;s iPads is any form of Touch ID, leaving any new iPad owners without the ability to authenticate via their fingerprint. I don&rsquo;t know why it wasn&rsquo;t included, possibly due to part constraints, but I do know that not having Touch ID on an iPad would annoy me much less than not having it on my iPhone. The iPad home button is nothing special, but then it was never marketed as such to begin with.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-buy">What to buy</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never owned an iPad before, or your last one was a 3rd generation model, now is a great time to be checking out the new hardware. Between the Air and the Retina Mini, the decision truly comes down to what you plan on using the iPad for. If you plan on doing a lot of typing and don&rsquo;t want to buy a wireless keyboard, I&rsquo;d push you in the direction of the Air, as the extra space makes for a much nicer on-screen typing experience. However, if your main use will be reading, playing games, or just browsing the web, I think you should check out the Retina Mini. The smaller size and weight make the Retina Mini an ideal travel companion, and the Retina Display provides a fantastic experience for consuming media.</p>
<p>Although the lack of Touch ID on either device is unfortunate, it&rsquo;s omission shouldn&rsquo;t sway any potential buyers. The Air and Retina Mini are, by far, the best tablets Apple has ever produced, and either one would make for an excellent investment.</p>

      <h2>The New Underdog</h2>
      <p>Dave Wiskus, an iOS developer, writing about his experience at the 2014 Microsoft Build conference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I say that walking around the floor of Microsoft’s Build conference was weird, I don’t mean that from the perspective of an iOS designer who crossed enemy lines. I felt more like some kind of war-torn refugee, returning to find that home had been rebuilt into a palace. For all the years I spent trying to escape from this company, the place seemed friendly. Bright colors, poppy music, happy people. Tones of Microsoft’s trademark dorkiness, for sure. But cut with a new sincerity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I had to pick one word to sum up the first few months of [Satya Nadella&rsquo;s]({% post_url 2014-02-04-satya-nadella %}) tenure at Microsoft, I would chose &ldquo;sincere.&rdquo; From Windows Phone 8.1 (which seems great) to the growing popularity of Microsoft Azure (their cloud-based developer tools), we are beginning to see the (re)building of an ethos that hasn&rsquo;t been around for a long time.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://theniftyminidrive.com">Nifty MiniDrive</a> is a new, 64GB SD card available for the Macbook. Although there is no shortage of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=64gb%20sd%20card&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=64gb%20sd%2Celectronics%2C358&amp;tag=kyldre-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics">SD cards available on Amazon</a> [affiliate link], the MiniDrive is shorter than a standard SD card, which means that, once inserted, it will remain flush against the side, instead of protruding out.</p>

      <h2>The NYT Diff</h2>
      <p>The Diff (presumably named for the programming notion of viewing changes in code) is a fascinating little device from the <em>Times</em> that monitors their online headlines and prints out a visual representation of any changes that occur. Noah Feehan, writing for the <em>NYT Labs</em> blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diff is a small device that monitors the internal events stream of The New York Times and prints out a summary each time an active headline is changed. As it runs, it generates a long stream of changes printed on thermal paper: text that was removed from a headline is rendered as inverted, while additions to a headline are underlined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end result is really <a href="http://blog.nytlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-30-14.19.56-e1383165196108-300x200.jpg">quite cool</a>, and it seems they took inspiration from <a href="http://newsdiffs.org">NewsDiffs.com</a>, a site that does the same thing as Diff, but also tracks changes to the articles themselves.</p>
<p>As someone who loves the intersection of technology and writing, I love this type of stuff.</p>

      <h2>The Privacy We Give Away</h2>
      <p>Naoki Hiroshima recently went through a horrifying experience of <a href="https://medium.com/p/24eb09e026dd">losing his Twitter handle, @N</a>. Through social engineering, a hacker was able to access Hiroshima&rsquo;s GoDaddy account, email, and Facebook profile, and then used them to exhort Hiroshima for access to the Twitter username. The whole story is chilling, and many of us are far more susceptible to this sort of event than we think. Hiroshima:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to log in to my GoDaddy account, but it didn’t work. I called GoDaddy and explained the situation. The representative asked me the last 6 digits of my credit card number as a method of verification. This didn’t work because the credit card information had already been changed by an attacker. In fact, all of my information had been changed. I had no way to prove I was the real owner of the domain name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responding to Hiroshima&rsquo;s plight, Josh Bryant <a href="http://d.pr/n/KUMK">posted his own story, regarding his Twitter handle @jb</a>. However, what I found most interesting about both these stories was how open the hackers in each situation was about <em>how</em> they went about hacking the accounts. Bryant, regarding the responses from his hacker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He explained that he first started by doing a little research and learning every piece of information he could find on me through public records. My Twitter profile linked to my website, my website had WHOIS information. I use a very very old address on all my public WHOIS records, but it happens to be the address of my parents, and since I’ve shipped gifts to my parents through Amazon, they had that address on file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Privacy we have taken from us is one issue, but an equal problem is the privacy we give away for free, which, once released, can never be truly restored.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their relationship began like a storybook high-school romance: a prom date, love notes, sneaking off to be alone. But unlike other kids at school, they had to keep their dating secret, because their parents disapproved. Both of them, but especially Adnan, were under special pressure at home, and the stress of that spilled over into their relationship. Eventually Hae broke up with Adnan. And then, depending on who you ask, Adnan was either understandably sad and moping around, or full of rage and plotting to kill her.</p>

      <h2>The Unpublished</h2>
      <p>Sometimes, as a writer, a nagging thought or idea will torment you relentlessly until you slay it with a hot iron sword of words and punctuation. However, not all battles lead to a publishable work; sometimes the ideas were so battered by the battle, the only consolation they can give is the peace of mind that you emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to the unpublished posts of writers everywhere. To that idea that needed written out, but then offered up little in the way of adding anything meaningful to existing conversations. To the countless drafts that will never see the light of a visitor&rsquo;s screen. To the hours spent writing from one side of an argument, only to realize that you might, in fact, support the obverse.</p>
<p>Quality posts are the byproduct of many that were never published. A necessary sacrifice, and one that every writer will have to make countless times. And, for certain, the only way to ensure the published count remains atop the un is to keep writing, and never stop.</p>

<li><em>CNN</em> put out a great photo set of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/world/gallery/most-beautiful-libraries-in-the-world">the worlds most exquisite libraries</a>,&rdquo; and the images are incredible. There are many places I&rsquo;d love to visit in this world, but these libraries just jumped to the top of my list.</li>
<li>Arina Pozdnyak, a graphic designer from Russia, has created the first calendar I&rsquo;d ever consider hanging on a wall. Called the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Perpetual-Calendar/11908945">Perpetual Calendar</a>,&rdquo; each month features a beautiful landscape with the month name set in the ultralight weight of Helvetica Neue. Fantastic.</li>
<li>Maria O&rsquo;Connell, writing for Whittaker Associates&rsquo;s blog, wrote a piece called &ldquo;<a href="http://whittakerassociates.com/not-just-coffee-starbucks%E2%80%99-rise-to-success/">Not Just Coffee: Starbuck&rsquo; Rise to Success</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a great read, particularly over a cup of coffee, and I finally got the answer to a question I had as to why round tables are so prevalent in Starbucks:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The round tables in a Starbucks store were strategically created in an effort to protect self-esteem for those coffee-drinkers flying solo. After all, there are no “empty” seats at a round table. Service counters are built out of natural materials like warm woods and stone, rather than plastics and metals, to create a homier atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Toby Osbourn, a developer working at Buffer (that social media app), wrote about <a href="http://tosbourn.com/2013/12/productivity/the-problems-i-am-facing-with-being-able-to-work-whenever-i-want/">some of the challenges of working remotely</a>. Although I&rsquo;m incredibly fond of remote work as an alternative to the normal 9-5 work day, there have been a lack of first-hand discussions surrounding the growing pains of moving to a remote work style.</li>
<li>Nick Heer, my online buddy who writes over at <em><a href="http://pxlnvy.com">Pixel Envy</a></em>, tweeted a link to an interesting art project he worked on called &ldquo;Departures.&rdquo; As a web designer, most of what I see that constitutes &ldquo;art&rdquo; is digital, made of pixels and only visible on a screen connected to the internet. So when I see something real-world and tangible made by someone I know primarily by their online work, I feel it deserves some attention.</li>
<li>Gretchen Reynolds, for <em>The New York Times</em> &ldquo;Well&rdquo; health and fitness blog, <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/why-a-brisk-walk-is-better/">wrote a groundbreaking piece</a>, revealing that the faster you walk the more healthy you probably are. <em>Note: The same holds true for exercise in general; the more you exercise, the more healthy you probably are. Same for food; the better you eat, the more healthy you probably are.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope everyone&rsquo;s had a great start to December, and, as always, thanks for reading.</p>

      <h2>The Wrong Dictionary</h2>
      <p><a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">James Somers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In a dictionary], words are boiled to their essence. But that essence is dry, functional, almost bureaucratically sapped of color or pop, like <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Pruitt-Igoe-overview.jpg">high modernist architecture</a>. Which trains you to think of the dictionary as a utility, not a quarry of good things, not a place you’d go to explore and savor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Worse, the words themselves take on the character of their definitions: they are likewise reduced. A delightful word like “fustian” — delightful because of what it means, because of the way it looks and sounds, because it is unusual in regular speech but not so effete as to be unusable, is described, efficiently, as “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” Not only is this definition (as we’ll see in a minute) simplistic and basically wrong, it’s just not in the same class, English-wise, as “fustian.” The language is tin-eared and uninspired. It’s criminal: This is the place where all the words live and the writing’s no good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should have linked to this when Mr. Somers&rsquo; wrote it, back in May, but it fell to the bottom of my list, after graduation. I wish it hadn&rsquo;t; this is one of my favorite pieces on writing from this past year.</p>

      <h2>Things I Could Have Bought</h2>
      <p>As I sat here <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/423184317494603776">debating which RSS syncing service to invest in</a>, a familiar tug on my conscience appeared. Do I really need this service? What problem does it solve? Could $18 be better spent?</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, God&rsquo;s been asking me these types of questions, and I&rsquo;ve done my best to avoid listening. But tonight, inspired in part by my soon-to-be sister-in-law&rsquo;s <a href="http://lifeloveandwords.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/a-year-of-nothing-new/">yearlong hiatus from buying anything nonessential</a>, I finally stopped avoiding His queries. After some reflection, I&rsquo;ve decided to take six months off from buying anything digital. Specifically, &ldquo;digital&rdquo; can refer to: apps, online subscriptions, music, and domain names — I&rsquo;ll add more to this list as I find them.</p>
<p>How many books on my desk still remain unread? Do I ever <em>really</em> become proficient with a an app if I switch every couple weeks? Which of the last few domains I purchased have I actually used? These are all questions that I want to stop feeling embarrassed about when answering, and the best means to that end is to put a hold on adding to the problem.</p>
<p>This might sound unorthodox for a writer who focuses on some of the very things he&rsquo;s giving up, but I&rsquo;ve found that listening to the small questions from God can return the biggest rewards. If you want to follow me in this challenge, bookmark this page; I&rsquo;ll be updating it with the price and name of anything that I get the inclination to buy. I&rsquo;m curious how high the total savings get come July 15th.</p>

      <h2>Three part relationship</h2>
      <p>Cue scene. Two people, attracted to the other, enter into a form of friendship that seems to extend beyond the capacity of a friendship. Slowly, as time goes by, those two people begin to build a new sort of relationship; one that is the curation of the experiences they&rsquo;ve shared together as a couple. It&rsquo;s an awesome thing to watch others go through, and to have the opportunity to experience yourself.</p>
<p>However, all romantic relationships, particularly those started when both people are young, can be difficult to keep growing. The key to keeping them healthy is a layer of trust and honesty between those two most intimately involved in the relationship: each person and God.</p>
<p>Being able to have a strong layer of trust and reliance on God  is an amazing thing to have. All relationships are going to have tough times to work out and won&rsquo;t always be flowing smoothly, but having that relationship with God to fall back is incredibly comforting in times of stress and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Knowing my relationship with Him is forever with me has dramatically changed thew way I view relationships. When I look at the relationship I have now, I see three parts: me, my lovely girlfriend and God. Whenever either she or I have felt the relationship wasn&rsquo;t clicking as well as it could be, it&rsquo;s usually because we have payed too much attention to the Two Part relationship, not the one where God is ever present, constantly speaking to us. When we refocus to that, our relationship deepens and grows like crazy.</p>
<p>Relationships are tough, but with God nothing ever seems insurmountable. Time, practice and patience are required. Coffee+devotional dates are necessary. And you must be willing to listen when He speaks to you.</p>

      <h2>Threes!</h2>
      <p>New math-based iOS game from the creators of <a href="http://www.ridiculousfishing.com">Ridiculous Fishing</a>, <a href="http://aeiowu.com">Greg Wohlwend</a> and <a href="http://ashervollmer.tumblr.com/home">Asher Vollmer</a>. Blending math and strategy, Threes! looks incredibly addicting. If you are more of a visual person, I found <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">the trailer</a> does a great job of explaining the gameplay.</p>
<p>Andrew Webster, writing <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/6/5361708/threes-ipad-iphone-puzzle-game">for <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your time in Threes is really only spent doing one thing — adding numbers together to make bigger ones. Yet it remains constantly engaging despite its seemingly simplistic nature. It may be about numbers, but Threes is really a strategy game at heart. In order to get the really big numbers — the ones you&rsquo;ll need to inflate your high score and pose a challenge on the online leaderboards — you&rsquo;ll need to plan at least a few moves ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interesting to read, Ben Kuchera, over on Polygon, has the backstory to Threes! and why it took <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5386200/why-it-took-a-year-to-make-and-then-break-down-an-amazing-puzzle-game">over a year to develop</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They kept trying to add new concepts, new themes and, in some cases, new mechanics. These ideas might have been interesting, but they hid what made the game fun; the simple act of matching numbers in multiples of threes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every time I added anything like that, it always felt unwieldy and unnatural. It just didn’t want to be there,&rdquo; Vollmer explained. &ldquo;Every time I took that stuff out it felt like a good game again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Threes! is, cutely, 33.333333% off for a limited time, which puts it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10ltSa">at only $1.99 on the App Store</a> [affiliate link]. If you like puzzle games in the same vein as <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a> and <a href="http://www.spelltower.com">SpellTower</a>, I have a feeling you are in for a treat.</p>

      <h2>Tim Van Damme on The Great Discontent</h2>
      <p>Over on <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com">The Great Discontent</a> (TGD), Tina Essmaker just published her <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/tim-van-damme">interview with Dropbox designer, Tim Van Damme</a>.</p>
<p>I have followed the work of Van Damme, <em>maxvoltar</em>, for the past five years. I initially heard about Van Damme when I was looking into the faces behind the, now defunct, Gowalla iOS app. Van Damme, originally from Belgium, was one of their designers. After Gowalla was acquired by Facebook, I then followed Van Damme&rsquo;s career as he moved to Instagram. Ironically enough, it was not too long after Facebook had acquired Gowalla that they came knocking to buy Instagram.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After spending some time with Instagram after the acquisition, Van Damme announced that <a href="http://maxvoltar.com/archive/hello-dropbox">his next move would be to Dropbox</a>. He currently works there, helping design their mobile experiences.</p>
<p>This interview was great for a couple reasons. Firstly, Van Damme has been someone I incredibly respect and look up to in the field of design and usability. Secondly, his poise and humbleness while answering the interview questions came across with a genuine honesty that many interviews lack. Finally, there are so many great perspectives that young (and old) designers can take away from how Van Damme approaches his craft.</p>
<p>There were plenty of quotes to pull from, but I feel this one is particularly important, regardless what type of work you may be doing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young people want everything immediately, but it takes time. What I love about our industry is that it doesn’t matter what kind of degree you have: you have to show up and show people what you can do. There’s no bullshitting yourself through an interview process. You have to work really hard for it, and there’s an honesty to it that I love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Damme&rsquo;s focus on family, dedication to his work, and pursuit of humbleness make him someone worth admiring.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it nice when your heroes exceed the standards you quietly held them to?</p>

      <h2>Tobias Frere-Jones is Suing Jonathan Hoefler</h2>
      <p>This news broke yesterday afternoon, but I wanted to let it simmer for a while before commenting. Given that <a href="http://www.typography.com">Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones (H&amp;FJ)</a> is one of the world&rsquo;s best type foundries (their fonts in use by Nike, the Obama campaign, and numerous other national agencies), I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether the headlines about one of the founders suing the other were simply sensational and overreacting to something much smaller.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>If you read the <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=ydQwzs4EZjDkplRrBmkkwA==&amp;system=prod">actual NYC claims document</a>, it becomes immediately clear that Hoefler intentionally broke his promise of giving Frere-Jones a 50% stake in the company. From the claims document (emphasis mine), starting with #13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 . The heart of the proposal was that <strong>Frere-Jones would contribute his name, reputation, industry connections and design authority</strong>, as well as obtain and assign to HTF the rights to certain fonts he had already developed at Font Bureau (referred to as the &ldquo;Dowry Fonts&rdquo;) <strong>in exchange for half of the equity in Hoefler&rsquo;s existing business, HTF</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>14 . A critical part of the creation of the new partnership was that Frere-Jones would &ldquo;have his name on the door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One world-class type designer and one savvy businessman, who were friends, going into business together makes perfect sense. However, things get shady when we skip down to #29:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>29 . After he signed the Sale and Assignment of Type Fonts, <strong>Frere-Jones repeatedly asked Hoefler to complete his part of the bargain and transfer half of the ownership in HTF to him</strong>, and Hoefler repeatedly acknowledged his obligation to do so, but each time begged off purportedly due to the pressures of work or his personal life. As a good partner, Frere-Jones respected Hoefler&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most incriminating sections finish with #42-43:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>42 . On October 21, 2013, for the first time, Hoefler explicitly reneged on his personal agreement to transfer 50% of HTF to Frere-Jones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>43 . Upon information and belief, <strong>Hoefler transferred to his wife, Borsella, the shares that he had promised to Frere-Jones</strong> and Hoefler and Borsella are now the owners of 100% of HTF.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, Hoefler knowingly used Frere-Jones&rsquo; reputation, connections, and fonts, without any intention of giving Frere-Jones his 50% of the company. Magnifying the problem, according to #42, Hoefler gave what was supposed to be Frere-Jones&rsquo; stake to Mrs. Hoefler, letting the Hoeflers own 100% of Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/13141-tobias-frerejones-is-suing-jonathan-hoefler-for-being-denied-a-50-stake-in-their-business">Designers across the web</a> are concerned, not only for the fate of the preeminent type foundry, but also for the company&rsquo;s latest product: <a href="http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/">Cloud.typography</a>; a way to use H&amp;FJ&rsquo;s fonts on websites.</p>
<p>And, according to #49 in the claims document, there is real reason to be concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>49 . Frere-Jones has suffered damage from the breach in an amount to be determined at trial <strong>but not less than $20 million</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a legal situation similar to that when Eduardo Saverin sued Mark Zuckerberg over Saverin&rsquo;s share in Facebook, it&rsquo;s not a stretch to say that nothing good happens when friends sue each other for millions of dollars.</p>

<li>Text size is tied to iOS 7&rsquo;s dynamic font size in Settings.app &gt; General &gt; Text Size.</li>
<li>A night theme is coming(!).</li>
<li>Tweetbot 2 will eventually return to the App Store, but you can re-download it if you&rsquo;ve previously purchased a copy in App Store.app &gt; Purchased.</li>

      <h2>Tweetbot 3.0</h2>
      <p>The best Twitter client for iOS got a huge update this week. Tapbots completely redesigned Tweetbot to match the aesthetic of iOS 7, and it&rsquo;s currently on sale for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id722294701?mt=8">$2.99 in the App Store</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tapbots painted themselves into a corner with their previous look and feel — they were the ziggyest thing going, but with iOS 7, Apple zagged. They&rsquo;ve figured out a way to drop the zig but still maintain a very distinctive character in the app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shawn Blanc in <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/10/video-review-new-tweetbot-ios7/">his review + video</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you launch the new Tweetbot for the first few times, there is certainly a bit of shell shock at just how different it is. But, as you use it, you realize that it&rsquo;s still a Tapbots app at heart. It&rsquo;s just as delightful and just as powerful as its siblings, but it marks the next generation of Tapbots apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federico Viticci, writing for <em>MacStories</em>, in the fantastically-detailed <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all/">Tweetbot 3 Review: Human After All</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like iOS 7, I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;ll like the new Tweetbot. [&hellip;] The old Tweetbot was the culmination of Tapbots&rsquo; years of experience with utility robots applied to a Twitter client; Tweetbot 3 is a new start for the company, which has to prove they can still make fantastic utilities that are easy to use and powerful, fun and packed with features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Tweetbot for the past few years, and Tweetbot 3 is the best version yet. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to toss a few bucks in Tapbots&rsquo; direction for this one.</p>

      <h2>Two thoughts and an idea for Work in Progress</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of Work in Progress (WIP), an informal video series about product design by Jason Fried, of Basecamp, and Nate Kontny, of Highrise. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun, and I encourage you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDvHTqzl1H6j9JKHiQZn4Cw">check out their YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HITjjXdbsd4">Show #16</a>, both Jason and Nate started chatting about ways they could increase viewership. Ideas ranged from email blasts to putting the audio version of WIP on iTunes. Since the show is still young, and I&rsquo;ve watched almost every episode, I thought it might help if I wrote up a my thoughts on how it&rsquo;s going so far.</p>
<hr>
<p>Jason and Nate,</p>
<p>I love the informal setting, and I think the laid-back nature keeps the format fun and, more importantly, inviting to someone who&rsquo;s either a.) new to product design, or b.) new to the both of you. You&rsquo;ve created a great atmosphere. By keeping things somewhat unstructured, you&rsquo;re also letting the audience take a peek at how cadence and honesty are two huge pieces of any discussion about design.</p>
<p>Regarding the length of each show, I think a half-hour is the sweet-spot for these types of discussions. There&rsquo;s no shortage of podcasts that run for well over an hour, so having a show that is conscientious of my time is nice. I feel that 30 minutes is low time commitment for the hosts, yet still allows for plenty of tangental mini-conversations throughout the episode. I think you could experiment with even shorter, single topic shows, but I&rsquo;d be afraid that  too short a length would introduce an unwelcome sense of rush.</p>
<p>Finally, an idea:</p>
<p>Something fun to try would be working through a design or page <em>with</em> the audience. Consider doing a small design riff on something that you are currently working on or have already done. Jason has talked about sharing some of the screens from Basecamp 3 in a month or so, but I think there&rsquo;s potential in working through old product designs, even if they&rsquo;re mockups that ended up getting scrapped.</p>
<p>Having the actual pixels in front of you and us might spark memories and offer visible evidence of the more subtle details a design embodies; details that tend to get forgotten when only looking at the end result.</p>
<p>Thanks for doing WIP, and I hope to see many more!</p>
<p>—KD</p>

      <h2>Two types of photographs</h2>
      <p>There are typically two types of photographs. The ones where the subjects are staged and ready for the shot, and the other where they are caught in the middle of another activity. I love the latter.</p>
<p>Photographs, to me, represent a snapshot of our personalities. I have nothing against staged photographs, where would family portraits be without them, but I prefer to see photos of people <em>doing</em> things. Riding a bike, about to kiss, or caught mid laughing. These are the photos that best represent the subject and their personality.</p>

      <h2>Two years</h2>
      <p>[One year ago]({% post_url 2012-03-23-one-year %}) I wrote about how blessed I felt that God put Emily in my life. One year later we know each other better than ever, and I wake up each morning excited when I think about what the future holds for us.</p>

<p>Timothy Keller once wrote that there is no feeling like &ldquo;the profound satisfaction of being known <em>and</em> loved.&rdquo; Over the past two years, Emily has shown me that she not only loves me, but all my quirks as well. It&rsquo;s a profound feeling of peace and safety that I have affectionately come to call &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Amongst everything else, I find it incredible that I&rsquo;ve found a girl who has redefined such a fundamental term for me.</p>
<p>Keeping it Oreo focused, making time for coffee dates, and chasing down the occasional stray animal to try and make it our pet, I cannot wait to see where God leads us during the next year. I couldn&rsquo;t be more happy.</p>

      <h2>Two-Thousand Forty-Eight</h2>
      <p><a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048 is a new free, web-based game</a>  that mimics the gameplay of the popular iOS game, <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes!</a> The same tile-mashing rules apply — only tiles of the same value can be combined — but 2048 changes the way that tiles move. Specifically, moving tiles in any direction <em>slides</em> those tiles until they hit a wall or another tile. You lose the fine-grained control over each move that I love in Threes!, but it does provide a unique spin on the original concept.</p>

      <h2>Typekit</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a> to serve up the fonts you see here and have been very pleased. Normally, when you want to use a custom font on your website, you need to make sure it&rsquo;s a font that your visitors have installed on their machines. If they don&rsquo;t have that particular font, their browser will revert to using a default, and ugly, backup.</p>
<p>However, Typekit lets you use any font you want, even if the visitor doesn&rsquo;t have it installed. They currently offer serveral different pricing plans: Free, Personal, Portfolio, Performance and Business. Difference between the plans includes how many fonts you can access, and how many websites you can use them on. For now, the Free plan works great for me, but if I ever have a client that needed custom fonts, I know where I&rsquo;m going to go.</p>
<p>As much as I love Helvetica and Georgia, I can&rsquo;t get enough of the PT Sans that I&rsquo;m currently using. After actual page content, good typography might be the most important thing you can add to your site.</p>

      <h2>Uber Taken to Court Over Death of Child</h2>
      <p>Uber, the company that offers on-demand taxi rides via mobile app, is <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/uber-and-a-childs-death/">being taken to court over the death of 6-year-old Sofia Liu</a>. Liu was hit and killed by one of Uber&rsquo;s cars on New Year&rsquo;s Eve by an Uber driver who was waiting for a fare.</p>
<p>Uber asserts that Uber drivers without fares are not Uber cars. The suit, filed by Chris Dolan, a San Francisco lawyer, directly challenges this effort by the company to detach itself from its own users. It says Uber needs the vehicles to be logged into the Uber app — that’s the only way potential riders know there is a car in the vicinity. So even when there is no fare in the car, the drivers are in essence on the clock, working for Uber.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1009476-uber-liu-update.html">actual suit</a> only argues that Uber&rsquo;s mobile app is not configured with a hands-free mode (as required by local driving laws); however, this case demonstrates the blurred legality regarding who is ultimately responsible for damages that come from services that facilitate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy">shared economy</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another example of shared economy legal troubles comes from 2011, when Airbnb, the service that lets you rent out your unoccupied spaces, was presented with <a href="http://blog.airbnb.com/our-commitment-to-trust-and-safety/">the vandalized home of one of their users</a>. Airbnb eventually did the right thing and implemented a $50,000 protection policy, but their delay in doing so caused unnecesary harm to the trust between Airbnb and their users. Uber would do well to take note from Airbnb&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Uber and Kalanick&rsquo;s cowardly response of immediately using their own drivers as scapegoats does little to inspire confidence for potential and existing drivers of the service. And, considering that that all Uber applicants are required to <a href="https://partners.uber.com/signup/san-francisco/p2p/">provide their address, driver&rsquo;s license, date of birth, social security number, and complete a background check done</a>, some may feel that the benefits no longer outweigh the costs.</p>

      <h2>Using the right tools</h2>
      <p>The other day I was trying to open the battery cover on our new electronic-banking Monopoly game set. I was having a problem getting the cover off because it was screwed into the hard plastic casing that made up the banking device. Quickly looking around for a phillips screwdriver proved unsuccessful, so I did what any other man would do; improvised.</p>
<p>After trying to use both a butter knife and a slightly bent paper clip, I was still unable to open the battery door. I took one more look around the house and finally found a phillips head screw driver. Within 10 seconds of using the right tool, I had the casing off and was inserting the new batteries.</p>
<p>It may seem like a no brainer that the Phillips head screw driver would most easily back out the philips screw, but how often do we try and accomplish tasks throughout our lives without using the right tool. A task that only took 10 seconds with the right equipment could have ended up taking much longer had I still been trying to use the bent paper clip.</p>
<p>What sort of “tools” are you using in your life and are the the right ones for the job? Remember, tools don&rsquo;t have to be in the form of a hammer or screwdriver, a tool can be your Bible or your favorite Christian CD. If you&rsquo;re trying to build up a relationship with God, using the right tools can make a huge difference. Spend some time during the next few days identifying what tools you are using in your daily life and whether they are the best ones for the job. If they aren&rsquo;t, maybe it&rsquo;s time to look into some alternative ways to go about achieving your goals.</p>

      <p>Callum Haywood has put together an online-privacy awareness site called <a href="http://www.weknowwhatyouredoing.com/">We Know What You&rsquo;re Doing</a>.

<p>This site operates in similar vein to the, now defunct, <a href="http://pleaserobme.com/">PleaseRobMe.com</a>. PleaseRobMe pulled in public check-in data from Foursquare, alluding to the notion that if someone is checking-in to a cafe, their home is unoccupied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s shown not only that we&rsquo;re dumber when we do this [multi-task] (an average of 10 IQ points dumber — that&rsquo;s the same as pulling an all-nighter.), but that we&rsquo;re also 40% less efficient at whatever it is we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>Twentysomethings: we really shouldn&rsquo;t be ignoring these trends. One of the most important contributing factors to being productive is the amount of uninterupted time you get each day.

      <h2>Where Every Story Looks the Same</h2>
      <p>The trend towards big and beautiful online article design is becoming more common. This past year, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/redesign/">went through a large redesign</a>, focusing on bigger type and giving every article a command of the page. Just this last month, Time.com <a href="http://time.com/13113/time-coms-redesign/">did the same</a>, rolling out a new, bigger layout — following the same large-article trend as the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p>Although these new layouts bode well for readability, Felix Salmon, writing for <em>Rueters</em>, argues that the change in design <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/27/against-beautiful-journalism/">removes important visual cues</a> that determine whether an article is important or not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More to the point, news websites have always struggled with any one-size-fits-all approach to stories. A format which works for a 6,000-word feature is not going to work well for a 150-word brief. Web designers have known this for years, but still news sites tend to put all of their stories into exactly the same template — and increasingly that template is designed for ambitious longform storytelling. Which, of course, generally accounts for only a tiny fraction of the material on the site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on, explaining that the new design pulls a bait-and-switch on the reader, ruining expectations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result is a cognitive disconnect: why is the website design telling me that this short blog post is incredibly important, when in reality it’s just a blockquote and a single line of snark? [&hellip;] It’s time for websites to put a lot more effort into de-emphasizing less important stories, reserving the grand presentation formats only for the pieces which deserve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All valid points, but I think Salmon misses the mark.</p>
<p>I would argue that the readers of today don&rsquo;t notice, or care all that much, that all of the <em>Times&rsquo;s</em> articles have the same layout. For a generation that has grown up getting their news on the internet, a literal smorgasbord of different layouts and designs, bigger text and full-width images doesn&rsquo;t always imply importance. Where Salmon calls for the web designs to &ldquo;bring back a little bit of noise and clutter&rdquo; for the sake of visual hierarchy, I would rather do without.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The new designs used by the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Time</em> may not cater to those readers who relied on visual cues to curb their reading. However, the new layouts, from what I can gather, are a strong attempt to make reading experience a priority, regardless of what piece you may be viewing.</p>
<p>In an world where your readers will be using hundreds of different devices to read your content, ensuring <em>everything</em> looks good <em>everywhere</em> is worth the annoyance of change.</p>

      <h2>Whitney</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.linotype.com/2090/avenirnext.html">Avenir Next</a> has long been my typeface of choice for kyledreger.com. However, Avenir Next only comes pre-installed on OS X machines, which means that I had to fallback to system fonts for my Windows readers.</p>
<p>As I was working on a typographical refresh of the entire site, I decided that it was time to choose a webfont that would appear the same to <em>all</em> readers, as the font family would be served with the webpage itself and agnostic to the operating system. After looking at a variety of webfont hosts, my search inevitably ended with the renowned Hoefler and Co&rsquo;s <a href="http://cloud.typography.com">cloud.typography.com</a>.</p>
<p>I knew it would end here, too. Some of the most recognizable fonts in the world come from H&amp;Co. ([formerly H&amp;FJ]({% post_url 2014-01-18-hoefler-and-co %})), and I&rsquo;ve been eyeing their library of typefaces for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Next came the difficult part. Avenir Next is a <em>fantastic</em> typeface. It&rsquo;s got a geometric element to it, and the x-height is something I find aesthetically pleasing; finding a replacement font family would be no small task. However, after browsing through all of H&amp;Co&rsquo;s fonts, I couldn&rsquo;t help but fall in love with Whitney: a genuine and simple sans-serif. I find that the crisp and kerned letters — particularly at small font sizes — also helps keep things readable, even at a smaller font size (currently 14px).</p>
<p>I may experiment with a few other typefaces from H&amp;Co, but Whitney does an exceptional job at passing along my unspoken, rhetorical message. For now, I&rsquo;m extremely pleased, and things (literally) look fantastic.</p>

      <p>My family owns a Wii. However, we only own one game - Wii Sports.</p>
<p>I love Wii Sports, it&rsquo;s brilliant. Although it was primarily created as a way to show new Wii users the basics of the then-new interaction between the Wii remotes and gameplay, many of the games are incredibly addictive and well designed. In an area where Nintendo could have just included a tutorial, they chose to build something really awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure at some point my family will get another Wii game, I&rsquo;ve been eyeing up Mario Kart Wii, but for now we have fun with Wii Sports. It&rsquo;s a great game and a nice tribute to what putting in quality effort can do for your users. Thanks, Nintendo.</p>

      <h2>Words Matter</h2>
      <p><em>Subtitle: The FCC just stabbed the open internet in the heart.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, a DC court ruled against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), stating that internet service providers (ISPs like Time Warner Cable, Verizon, etc.) no longer have to be regulated under common carrier policies. Without going too deep into what is an incredibly confusing issue, often called &ldquo;net neutrality&rdquo; in the news, the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">common carrier</a> essentially labels a service — like phone lines — as <em>dumb pipes</em>; they can carry data back and forth between destinations, but the companies are not allowed to discriminating against what <em>type</em> of data is being transferred.</p>
<p>This is a very basic summation of all the information I&rsquo;ve read. Thankfully, Nilay Patel for <em>The Verge</em> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311948/net-neutrality-and-the-death-of-the-internet">wrote an excellent article</a> that outlines not just the effects of this ruling, but the history that lead up to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2002, the FCC made what would turn out to be a pivotal mistake. Instead of stating the blindingly obvious — internet service is a utility just like landline phone service — the FCC tried to appease the out-of-control corporate egos of behemoths like Verizon and Comcast by pretending internet providers were special and classifying them as &ldquo;information service providers&rdquo; and not &ldquo;telecommunications carriers.&rdquo; The wrong words. Then, once everyone was wearing the nametag they wanted, the FCC tried to impose common carrier-style telecommunications regulations on them anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the exact future ramifications of these proceedings will be, but you can be sure that the open, unfiltered nature of the internet is in jeopardy. Before, internet providers could only compete on speed and bandwidth offerings, leading to better services for consumers. Now, ISPs have the ability to directly attack the websites and services they, or their parent companies, don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>What a mess.</p>

      <p>Nick Bilton, for Vanity Fair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t take a political scientist to see that the world is on edge. And technology, we often forget, undergirds this political reality. The Internet and innovation have made cultures around the globe collide with historically unprecedented force. With the exception of perhaps a handful of rogue states, like North Korea, we all now eat at the same McDonald’s, use the same iPhones and discuss the same hot-button topics on the same social networks. Every corporation on the planet can do this thanks to—not in large part, but in all parts—technology.</p>

      <h2>Writer Pro for Mac</h2>
      <p>If you had to categorize me with one word, it would be &ldquo;writer.&rdquo;  As a student of computer science and rhetorical composition (fancy words for writing), I take the tools I use very seriously. The programmer in me wants efficiency and innovation, and the writer in me wants tools that facilitate accurate editing and my personal writing processes.  For a while, it was just me and TextEdit, the default text-editor on the Mac, pounding away. However, as I started writing more sophisticated forms of code and prose, my tools evolved. For coding, I started using Sublime Text. For writing, [I turned to iA Writer]({% post_url 2012-05-30-ia-writer-122 %}). Little has changed until today.</p>
<p>At midnight, Information Architects (iA) released a new version of Writer, dubbed Writer Pro. It&rsquo;s currently available in the iOS and Mac App Store, and costs just $19.99. I don&rsquo;t do much writing on my iPhone, so this post will focus on Writer Pro for Mac. Since last night, I&rsquo;ve used Writer Pro to write and edit over 8,000 words, including the ones in this very post. Here are some thoughts on my new favorite writing tool.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>The biggest visual change from Writer to Writer Pro is the new sidebar, which hangs on the right edge of the current document and is able to be hidden / shown at will with a keystroke. The sidebar holds information and options that used to sit in a semi-transparent bar across the bottom of the window. The new layout feels much cleaner.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the reasons for this new sidebar is the addition of something iA is calling Workflows. Writer Pro has four different Workflows for each stage of the writing process: Note, Write, Edit, and Read. When you switch from one workflow to another, the typography and accent color changes across the UI as well (except for Edit and Read, which have the same typeface).</p>
<p>In addition to giving a visual context clue to your current Workflow, a change in Workflows will actually move your current document into a corresponding iCloud folder. If you like using iCloud to organize your documents, this automation is a great &ldquo;just works&rdquo; experience. However, if you are like me and would rather store your documents somewhere else (a la Dropbox), changing Workflows only occurs within the app and won&rsquo;t move your documents around. As a nice touch, Writer Pro will reopen any documents in the Workflow you last closed them in, regardless where each document is saved.</p>
<p><em>Side note: Because Workflows, when used outside of iCloud, do nothing to change your file structure, you can simply use each Workflow as a way to change up the typography and accent color; having too many typography options tend to distract me, but having some variety available is nice.</em></p>
<h2 id="syntax-control">Syntax Control</h2>
<p>Writer Pro also brings with it something called Syntax Control — the coloring or highlighting of like words and phrases. Developers have had syntax &ldquo;highlighting&rdquo; in their code-editors for years, but Writer Pro&rsquo;s implementation doesn&rsquo;t focus on code-specific paradigms; rather, it allows you to highlight adjectives, nouns, adverbs, verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and whole sentences throughout your document.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s a damn clever feature for editing, and arguably one of the best writing-specific innovations added to a text-editor over the last five years.</p>
<p>I am currently in my fourth year of studying writing and rhetoric, so thinking about the syntax of my words (modifiers, appositives, adverbial phrases) <em>as I write them</em> is something of a habit. However, being able to see the grammatical makeup of my document within the contexts of sentences and paragraphs is fantastic. I feel Syntax Control is a huge step towards creating tools that help push digital editing beyond the traditional comment / collaborate scope.</p>
<p>For an example, Syntax Control has already proven helpful in identifying places where I tend to put two adverbs in a row. Take this example, copied from an earlier draft of this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>However, actually</strong> being able to see the words as I write them is great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence gets my meaning across, but &ldquo;however, actually&rdquo; feels clunky. I only really need one adverb, and the removal of “actually” doesn’t hurt the impact of the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, being able to see the words as I write them is great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clean and simple. Of all Writer Pro&rsquo;s new features, Syntax Control is the most exciting. Expect this to be copied by other writing applications in the future.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Aside from my desire to have Writer Pro automatically manage my documents in a directory other than iCloud&rsquo;s, I find it difficult to find any real complaints with the first version of this app. My only real quibble comes up when I&rsquo;m typing above a chunk of text and go to a new line; the text that should move down does not do so instantaneously and all at once, but rather (extremely) quickly line-by-line. It seems to be a graphical issue, one that could be fixed in an update, but it is still something that detracts slightly from the overall experience.</p>
<p>There are some people for whom Writer Pro is not. At $19.99, Writer Pro is a complete writing suite. Buying it because you&rsquo;re <em>somewhat</em> interested in new &ldquo;writing&rdquo; apps is a terrible idea. However, if you&rsquo;re someone who truly loves writing and does a lot of it, features like Syntax Control and the minimalistic writing environment can be helpful to your writing process.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m incredibly impressed with what iA has created in Writer Pro, and I&rsquo;m happy to use it as my primary writing tool. A deep and warm holiday &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to everyone on the team that helped ship this out. Tools do not a writer make, but iA has created an app that makes it easier for me to write, edit, and polish my ideas on a level worthy of the Pro moniker and price.</p>

      <h2>Writing like a hacker</h2>
      <p><em>Abstract: From history to English, I write all my school papers like a hacker. Using text editors without support for spell checking or formatting, I create a frictionless creative flow which allows me get my ideas out faster.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing for a long time, even though I&rsquo;m not the best at it. Nevertheless, ever since I was a little kid, I would sit down and write stories and journal away my life. Today, however, instead of crayons and pens on paper, I type.</p>
<p>When most people I see sit down to write, they fire up Microsoft Word and begin typing. However, they rarely get more than a few lines before they stop. They move the cursor back a couple steps and then right-click on a bright, red underlined misspelled word. After clicking the correctly spelled version, they continue on, only to stop a couple of lines later. Without even have a paragraph&rsquo;s worth of content and they are editing.</p>
<p>This completely kills the creative flow a writing process allows them to enter. Stopping every couple lines to fix something that has no impact on what they meant only wastes their time. It also can violently kick them out of a creative state of mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s the tool they are using. Microsoft Word is a word processor, meaning that it&rsquo;s job is to alert you to every misspelling, grammatical error and let you format your final document. This is all great for when you need to format your document, but when you&rsquo;re starting out with ideas, it can crush them because you get caught up in all those other things.</p>
<h3 id="hackers-do-it-differently">Hackers do it differently</h3>
<p>Computer &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t all malicious individuals trying to grab your VISA digits off the local Starbucks wifi. Most of them are just like me: enthusiastic about computers and the tools we use to interact with them. Most of our tools are simple. They do one or two things, but they do them phenomenally well. While the toolsets can vary greatly between individuals, the one tool every hacker has is a text editor.</p>
<p>The beauty of text editors is that they are practically ubiquitous with computers themselves. Pre-installed on almost every operating system, a text editor&rsquo;s default file format is the .txt (text) file extension, one of the most compatible format in the world. Working with text files, I&rsquo;ve never run into the problem of <strong>not</strong> being able to open my documents on a computer other than my own.</p>
<p>A text editor is exactly what it sounds like and rarely anything more. It <strong>edits</strong> text and lets you do it quickly. The list of what it doesn&rsquo;t do is strict:</p>
<ul>
<li>No spell checking</li>
<li>No bulleted lists</li>
<li>No images</li>
<li>No links</li>
<li>No bolding</li>
<li>No italics</li>
<li>No underlining</li>
</ul>
<p>Just text. The reason hackers love this is that it removes distraction. When I&rsquo;m sitting down to write code, I want to focus on code. The color and font are irrelevant. This makes writing code incredibly straightforward - just write code. Why can&rsquo;t english writers have the same benefit?</p>
<h3 id="my-writing-process">My writing process</h3>
<p>Taking this bare-bones approach to writing code, I decided that I wanted to apply the same principle to English writing. Almost 90% of my time spent writing looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up <a href="http://iawriter.com">iA Writer</a> - a super-simple text editor. One font, one size, no options.</li>
<li>Start dumping my thoughts into the page. My goal isn&rsquo;t to have a nicely formatted paper, it&rsquo;s to get all my ideas out and into words. My application doesn&rsquo;t point out misspellings, so often I don&rsquo;t even notice any of them until much later when I review.</li>
<li>Once I&rsquo;ve gotten all my ideas out, and expanded the new ones that came while I was writing, I do basic editing. Paragraph breaks, content flow and overall structure.</li>
<li>I read the entire document a couple times, refining it each time and adding, or moving, thoughts and sentences.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I&rsquo;m done, the paper is almost done. I haven&rsquo;t wasted a second being pulled backwards into my text to fix glowing red errors, or changing the font. For the entirety of my time, I&rsquo;ve been writing. Once I&rsquo;m done, I copy and paste the text into something like Microsoft Word to do the final touchup and spell checking. I print out the final product and I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Writing in a bare-bones text editor is like writing on pen and paper again. When I was little and, in my opinion, at my most creative, little red lines didn&rsquo;t show up under misspellings in my journal. I was free to write and get out my ideas. Bringing the new digital medium back to that level allows a writer to do what they&rsquo;ve been trying to do: write.</p>

      <h2>Writing simple code</h2>
      <p>With three different computer science classes this semester, I write a lot of code. However, being a minimalistic type of guy, I try to have my code require as little documentation as possible. I do this by writing my code so that it explains itself <em>without</em> the need for an army of comments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the coding tutorials online, and even sample code from my classes, end up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>// method to generate tip and return it to the sender
public float returnTheTipValue (float billTotalValue) {
    float theNewTip = .2 * billTotalValue; // calculate (20% of bill total)
    return theNewTip; // return value
} // end returnTheTipValue()
</code></pre>
<p>The above code generates how much you should tip your waiter/waitress based on your bill total. However, between the variable names and the comments (content after &ldquo;//&quot;), this code is difficult understand by just glancing at it.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s approach the same problem with a self-documented coding style. Taking the example above, the exact same thing can be accomplished with this modified code:</p>
<pre><code>public float getTip (float billTotal) {
    float tip = .2 * billTotal; // calculate a generous tip
    return tip;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Simple and to the point. This modified code is easier to read, and I can quickly understand what the method does by just looking at the name and its only comment.</p>
<p>While I personally write my code with this simple mindset, there are always situations where many comments and more complex variable names are not only useful, but essential. Most software companies have a coding style that outlines when programmers should document their code and how they should name their variables. Having consistent rules like this allows multiple programmers to work on the same code without worrying how the others are writing.</p>
<p>For me though, and for most college computer programmers, a simple, yet clear, approach to your documentation will save you lots of headaches down the road. Less is more.</p>

      <h2>WWDC 2014</h2>
      <p>After today&rsquo;s WWDC keynote, I need a week or so to absorb everything I just saw. Apple always puts on a great presentation, but they were in rare form this morning. A lot of the praise has to go to Craig Federighi (SVP of Software Engineering), who did a fantastic job as the unofficial MC. He brought an energy and charisma that was not only commanding, but also sincere.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/">OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a>, which features the aesthetic of iOS, while maintaining OS X&rsquo;s own identity and purpose. Available this Fall, for free.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/">iOS 8</a> and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/developer/">iOS 8 SDK</a> (software development kit). iOS 7 was all about about changing the design patterns, but iOS 8 is focused on opening the floodgates for developers to start building the next generation of powerful apps. All devices back to the iPhone 4 are able to upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what I think really blew developers away (myself included) was the introduction of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>; Apple&rsquo;s new programming language, designed to replace the currently-used Objective-C. If you&rsquo;re not sure why Swift is important, just know that it was an unprecedented and unexpected move, but it is one that will make programming OS X and iOS apps easier, faster, and better in the long run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel outlandish in saying that the Apple I saw today looked as strong, if not stronger, than I&rsquo;ve ever seen them before. Although I use Apple products, it&rsquo;s only ever been because I want to use the best tools available for what I do and how I like to do it. Today reaffirmed that Apple is focused and dedicated to giving me that option on their platform, and that they still know how to keep a secret.</p>

      <h2>Your Porch, Our Street</h2>
      <p><a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/from-the-porch-to-the-street/">Frank Chimero</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the frustration: if you’ve been on Twitter a while, it’s changed out from under you. Christopher Alexander made a great diagram, a spectrum of privacy: street to sidewalk to porch to living room to bedroom. I think for many of us Twitter started as the porch—our space, our friends, with the occasional neighborhood passer-by. As the service grew and we gained followers, we slid across the spectrum of privacy into the street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For about two years, I was on Twitter before any of my friends were; Twitter was always a public space to me. I enjoy using Twitter, more for reading than tweeting, but that is because I keep the number of accounts I follow (currently 90) to a minimum. I don&rsquo;t know how some people manage to follow hundreds — some, thousands — of other people.</p>

      <h2>Yours Truly, Speaking at Mount Union&#39;s Graduation</h2>
      <p>Three days ago, I graduated from the University of Mount Union. As the president of the Class of 2014, I had the distinct pleasure of giving the closing speech for our graduation ceremony, and the response has been overwhelming. To all those who reached out, for all the kind words and wishes, I give a heartfelt &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; and I feel incredibly blessed to have such good friends and family.</p>
<p>I also want to thank all the readers of this site. Posting should get back to normal this week, but I want to offer my thanks for all the support and feedback I have received over the past year. I have some exciting things lined up for kyledreger.com in the future, and I owe it all to you, the readers, for helping make this journey possible.</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, for reading.</p>
