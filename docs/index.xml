      <title>Edit for iOS</title>

      <description>Edit is a single page of paper, not a notebook. You get one note, and whatever you leave in the app will be there when you get back. Once you&amp;rsquo;re done writing, you can send or save your text to anywhere in iOS via the Share Sheet.
Edit doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to replace your existing writing apps, it wants to complement them.
What&amp;rsquo;s in the box?  One sheet: return instantly to what you were writing.</description>

      <description>These pages are run out of my own pocket and in my spare time. What it lacks in regularity is hopefully made up for in quality.
The sparse design is intentional. I&amp;rsquo;m prone to tinker with the layout, grids, colors, typography. But by keeping things simple, I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to actually write.
(Also, “Kyle” is fine—I just sign my name KQ. My favorite authors all went by first-initial-middle-initial-last-name, and I really like that style.</description>
