      <description>Had an interesting reflection experience.
I felt really inspired after watching some of Jeff Bethke&amp;rsquo;s videos. I took this inspiration, along with my Macbook, and went to the BnB cafe. I grabbed a drink, sat down and took some quiet time to clear my mind. What I ended up doing was writing my first “spoken word” poetry piece. I really liked how it turned out, so I got creative and even made a video for it.</description>
