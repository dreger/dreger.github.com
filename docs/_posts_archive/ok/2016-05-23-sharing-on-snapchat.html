  <h1>Snapchat and Sharing First Drafts</h1>
  <p>Recently, Chris Bowler asked the following question in his <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/newsletter">The Weekly Review</a> email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what does Snapchat offer people other than another distraction from getting work done? That’s a serious question. Do you have an answer? <em>Let me know</em>, I’d love to better understand how and why people use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By &ldquo;people,&rdquo; Mr. Bowler is referring to other creatives, those who might work in design, art, or writing fields.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon thinking about my answer to that question, and I arrived at this:</p>
<p>Sharing honest, rough draft work on most platforms means looking amateur next to the competition.</p>
<p>Snapchat runs the other way. Snapchat-the-platform encourages a &ldquo;shitty first draft&rdquo; mentality that creatives struggle to find elsewhere, even on services dedicated to in-progress work. [1] Unlike posts on Facebook, Twitter, Dribbble, and Instagram, Snapchat encourages rough-edged peeks into who we are and what we&rsquo;re doing. Snaps are born into a context that embraces messy. [2]</p>
<p>Additionally, Snapchat removes any affordance to meaningfully polish your work before sharing. You do have drawing tools and a limited selection of filters, but drawing with your finger is obtuse and the filters are the most basic implementation of such a feature. Most everything about Snapchat facilities sharing the in-progress, and I think creatives are latching on to that for their work and personalities. We&rsquo;re not always well-dressed, with ironed clothes, hair brushed or beards trimmed. Creative work is messy, and when you find creatives who openly acknowledge that, I think we all take a silent sigh of relief that it&rsquo;s not just us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something redeemable about the idea of a place to share work where full-time perfection isn&rsquo;t expected. That&rsquo;s what I think Snapchat offers. Snaps aren&rsquo;t your polished portfolio of creativity, and that&rsquo;s OK. Arguably, it&rsquo;s even needed.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>[1] As a consultant for my college writing center, I saw an alarming number of students come in with the idea that the quality of their first draft was an indicator of their writing ability. No. It&rsquo;s going to take 10 revisions before you&rsquo;ve got something that resembles good. The faster you accept this idea, the faster words will get on the page.</p>
<p>[2] Another trend I&rsquo;ve noticed, which deserves a separate article, is designers doing a live-stream of their work. This bears a similarity to Snapchat in that the premise of the experience is messy. Viewers get to see the mistakes, erasing, deleting. Seeing that isn&rsquo;t only expected, but also the most enjoyable part of these broadcasts.</p>
