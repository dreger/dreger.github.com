  <h1>WWDC 2014</h1>
  <p>After today&rsquo;s WWDC keynote, I need a week or so to absorb everything I just saw. Apple always puts on a great presentation, but they were in rare form this morning. A lot of the praise has to go to Craig Federighi (SVP of Software Engineering), who did a fantastic job as the unofficial MC. He brought an energy and charisma that was not only commanding, but also sincere.</p>
<p>It felt like Apple was the underdog again. They joked onstage, they were visibly excited, and they <em>knew</em> what they had would blow people away. And they were right.</p>
<p>Two of the big announcements:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/">OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a>, which features the aesthetic of iOS, while maintaining OS X&rsquo;s own identity and purpose. Available this Fall, for free.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/">iOS 8</a> and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/developer/">iOS 8 SDK</a> (software development kit). iOS 7 was all about about changing the design patterns, but iOS 8 is focused on opening the floodgates for developers to start building the next generation of powerful apps. All devices back to the iPhone 4 are able to upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what I think really blew developers away (myself included) was the introduction of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>; Apple&rsquo;s new programming language, designed to replace the currently-used Objective-C. If you&rsquo;re not sure why Swift is important, just know that it was an unprecedented and unexpected move, but it is one that will make programming OS X and iOS apps easier, faster, and better in the long run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel outlandish in saying that the Apple I saw today looked as strong, if not stronger, than I&rsquo;ve ever seen them before. Although I use Apple products, it&rsquo;s only ever been because I want to use the best tools available for what I do and how I like to do it. Today reaffirmed that Apple is focused and dedicated to giving me that option on their platform, and that they still know how to keep a secret.</p>
