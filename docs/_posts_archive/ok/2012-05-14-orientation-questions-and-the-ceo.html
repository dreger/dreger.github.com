  <h1>Smart people ask questions</h1>
  <p>Today marks the end of Orientation Day at <a href="http://timken.com">The Timken Company</a>. Hats off to the University relations team for putting together a great program for us; I&rsquo;ve been to much shorter programs which felt twice as long. Informative, fun and a great way to get our feet wet the first day.</p>
<p>I took plenty of things away from today, including one of the amazing spare lunches (boxed <a href="http://www.honeybakedham.com/catering.asp">Honey Baked Ham sandwiches</a>), but what I&rsquo;m most impressed with is how well they treat their interns. It&rsquo;s a foundation of respect that you feel, even though you&rsquo;re the lowest ones on the totem pole.</p>
<p>I turned out to be quite a successful at all the activities we had participated in today, netting three different gift cards as prizes, but something I wasn&rsquo;t expecting was a live presentation from the CEO and current President: <a href="http://www.timken.com/en-us/about/leadership/Pages/JamesWGriffith.aspx">James W. Griffith</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many CEO&rsquo;s of companies as large as Timken make time to come to an intern orientation day, but there can&rsquo;t be many. Seeing President Griffith and being able to spend 45 some minutes listening to him speak and then having our own personal Q&amp;A session was awesome. As much as I respected his position before this morning, I respect him that much more for making time for us.</p>
<h2 id="smart-people-ask-questions">Smart people ask questions</h2>
<p>Something that the session with President Griffith reminded me of was an article by Tommy MacWilliam called <a href="http://blog.tommymacwilliam.com/post/17500383225/what-ive-learned-about-smart-people">What I&rsquo;ve Learned About Smart People</a>. MacWilliam is a student at Harvard and has had the chance to be around <em>a lot</em> of incredibly intelligent individuals. From this, and the fact he seems to be a pretty bright guy himself, he&rsquo;s noticed that <strong>smart people ask questions</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smart people are different. If they don&rsquo;t understand something, or even if they think they understand something, they&rsquo;ll ask questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>It was this idea that persuaded me to raise my hand and ask President Griffith a question. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what I asked, it was something about how heavily Timken takes a business&rsquo;s patents into account when looking to acquire that company, but I knew I had to ask something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I wasn&rsquo;t really nervous and scribbled down a draft of my question to get the wording right, but after asking, not only did I feel proud - I also got a great response and direct conversation with the CEO.</p>
<p>Asking questions, especially when you are surrounded by people way smarter than yourself is always going to be intimidating. You don&rsquo;t want to sound stupid, or ask something that isn&rsquo;t relevant, but regardless how nervous you feel, just ask. Make it a good question and ask. It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will mark my first <em>actual</em> day of work for The Timken Company. It seems like a decade has passed since I first submitted my application and resum√©. I&rsquo;m ready to dive in. Here we go.</p>
