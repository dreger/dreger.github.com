  <h1>My Apps and Home Screen</h1>
  <p>You can tell a lot about a person by looking at how they set up their home screen and apps. This is mine as it currently stands on my iPhone 4:</p>
<p><img src="%7B%7Bsite.domain%7D%7D/public/2013-09-home-screen.jpg" alt="my iphone"></p>
<p>My home screen is a little more sparse than others, but this allows me to quickly get on and off my phone [without getting too distracted]({% post_url 2013-09-26-kraus-distraction %}).</p>
<h3 id="the-home-screen">The Home Screen</h3>
<ul>
<li>The wallpaper is courtesy of <a href="http://www.twentyfivethree.com/wallpapers/">Bradley Casteneda</a>, who has some real beautiful shots that fit perfectly with iOS 7.</li>
<li>I have a three-icon dock. Four down there feels too crowded, and two feels like I&rsquo;m sacrificing usability for the sake of minimalism. Three feels just right.</li>
<li>I no longer keep Camera or Clock on the first page, they&rsquo;re now tucked away in a folder for misfit apps. Because both are easily launched from Control Center, just a swipe away <em>in any app</em>, it was hard to justify them taking up space.</li>
<li>My apps are arranged in alphabetical order on two planes: the first page and then the dock.</li>
<li>I have no more than two pages of apps at a time. The second page isn&rsquo;t anything special, just two folders: one for apps I use, and one for apps I don&rsquo;t, but can&rsquo;t get rid of.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-apps">My Apps</h3>
<p>My app selection is small, but it works for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>App Store: I&rsquo;m constantly trying out new apps that have unique interfaces, or really great implementations of common ones. I also like to read the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new&rdquo; notes whenever one of my apps gets updated.</li>
<li>Bible: YouVersion&rsquo;s Bible isn&rsquo;t the fastest of the Bible applications I&rsquo;ve tried, but it is the best. Plus, the notes and highlights I make in the app sync to their web interface (<a href="http://bible.com">bible.com</a>) so I can read and study wherever I want.</li>
<li>Messages: I&rsquo;m in love with the new Messages interface for iOS 7. It&rsquo;s fun, colorful, and beautiful. The only thing that could be improved would be <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/381219337534595072">the emojis</a>. <em>Fun tip: when in a message thread, swipe right-to-left to see the timestamps for each message.</em></li>
<li>Newsstand: I use to absolutely loathe Newsstand. I didn&rsquo;t ever download magazines, much less read them on my iPhone. However, after seeing how well designed The New York Times iOS 7 app was, I&rsquo;ve really started to enjoy having high-quality news just a tap away for my daily lunch.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Students: The New York Times (among others), offers a huge discount to subscribers if you have a .edu email address. I&rsquo;m currently on their $.99-for-four-weeks promotion, but I plan on sticking with them through the end of this year. Check out <a href="http://homedelivery.nytimes.com/HDS/CMHome.do?mode=CMHome&amp;CampaignCode=393W8">The NYT&rsquo;s education discount page</a> and remember to always ask about .edu discounts when shopping for software or subscriptions.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Photos: The best camera is the one you have with you. My iPhone has captured so many precious memories of my life that I love having quick access to the most recent ones.</li>
<li>Safari: Without a doubt, one of my favorite apps on iOS. When the iPhone was first released, Safari was the first browser to offer <em>real</em>, modern web browsing for mobile devices. It&rsquo;s only gotten better with iOS 7, and will always have a place on my first page.</li>
<li>Settings: Control Center does 80% of what I typically need Settings for, but I access the other 20% (wallpapers, email settings, check data usage) too often to not have them readily available.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com">You Need A Budget</a> (YNAB): This app has singlehandedly helped me get my finances under control and create a sustainable, responsible budget. The effect has been profound. I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with this app, and am looking to do a full review once I&rsquo;ve been using it a couple more months.</li>
<li>Calendar: I live and die by my calendar. The basic rule of thumb is: if it&rsquo;s not on there, I&rsquo;m not going to it. One particularly useful part of both my fiancee and I having iPhones is that we can share a &ldquo;wedding&rdquo; calendar â€” so we&rsquo;re both aware of important dates.</li>
<li>Mail: I really don&rsquo;t get that much personal email, but I do get a ton for school. However, to help keep it from overwhelming me, I set the app to only check for new messages every half-hour, and I removed the unread message count badge. Now I check my email when I have time, not when it tells me to.</li>
<li>Vesper: This is [where I collect my thoughts]({% post_url 2013-07-13-vesper %}). It&rsquo;s delightful, simple, and looks great to boot. If you have any appreciation of Field Notes or small caps in typography, <a href="http://vesperapp.co">go check it out</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Each app has been specifically chosen because it&rsquo;s the best at what it does for me. Have a cool home screen or app you really love? I&rsquo;d love to <a href="mailto:comments@kyledreger.net">hear about it</a>.</p>
