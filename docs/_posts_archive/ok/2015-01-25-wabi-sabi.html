  <h1>Wabi-sabi</h1>
  <p>Through an odd series of events, which I will expand on another time, I went from owning an iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6 to my current iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Before this rapid iPhone transition, I had stayed on the near-cutting edge of iPhone releases. I liked owning the newest thing out of Cupertino, and every time I got the upgrade, I would tell myself that <em>this</em> was the last one I needed for the next five years. However, it wouldn&rsquo;t be more than six months, before I began imagining myself with the, then still rumored, next iPhone.</p>
<p>What a treadmill. It makes me somewhat sick to think about the amount of time that I&rsquo;ve spent reading Apple rumor blogs, speculating about what my &ldquo;next&rdquo; thing was going to be. The line between tech enthusiasm and unhealthy consumer lusting became increasingly blurred.</p>
<p>So, you can imagine my surprise, as I upgraded, and then double-downgraded to the iPhone 5. At the time, in my mind, this setup would only be for a week, until I could get another iPhone 6. However, day after day, a week turned into four months.</p>
<p>How and why are fair questions to ask, and I&rsquo;ve spent some time trying to figure out the answers. However, after stumbling back across Remy Labesque&rsquo;s <a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/aged-to-perfection.html">Aged to Perfection</a> post, I realized why I was uncharacteristically OK with my current phone.</p>
<p>The Japanese concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</a> is the world view of embracing the wear and tear of everyday things â€” of finding beauty in the natural aging process. Wabi-sabi directly contradicts our yearly tech upgrade cycle, but in turn, it gives a unique, very natural sense of peace, as our things become increasingly battered.</p>
<p>My iPhone 5 reflects the experiences of a full life. Scratches on the back aluminum, dents along the chamfered edge, and a slight discoloration of the rear Apple logo serve as a permanent reminder of the life I&rsquo;ve lived so far with this rectangular slab of glass in my pocket.</p>
<p>It may sound incredibly conceited or #FirstWorldProblem-ish for me to write that I can manage with &ldquo;just&rdquo; an iPhone 5, and I concede to that interpretation. However, with that concession, I&rsquo;m going to use this opportunity to encourage you to take a moment and contemplate where your own line of consumerism / enthusiasm lies. If you can&rsquo;t find it, there is a chance that you&rsquo;ve merged both doctrines into one easily-defendable lifestyle, which reinforces itself with every upgrade. That was me, anyhow.</p>
<p>My iPhone will, eventually, have to be replaced. However, until then, I remain pleasantly surprised in the amount of joy I get from seeing the aesthetic imperfections. Joy that, mind you, far exceeds anything I&rsquo;ve felt while peeling plastic film off a mint-condition device.</p>
