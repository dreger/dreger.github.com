  <h1>Two years</h1>
  <p>[One year ago]({% post_url 2012-03-23-one-year %}) I wrote about how blessed I felt that God put Emily in my life. One year later we know each other better than ever, and I wake up each morning excited when I think about what the future holds for us.</p>

<p>Timothy Keller once wrote that there is no feeling like &ldquo;the profound satisfaction of being known <em>and</em> loved.&rdquo; Over the past two years, Emily has shown me that she not only loves me, but all my quirks as well. It&rsquo;s a profound feeling of peace and safety that I have affectionately come to call &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Amongst everything else, I find it incredible that I&rsquo;ve found a girl who has redefined such a fundamental term for me.</p>
<p>Keeping it Oreo focused, making time for coffee dates, and chasing down the occasional stray animal to try and make it our pet, I cannot wait to see where God leads us during the next year. I couldn&rsquo;t be more happy.</p>

<p>Love you, sweetheart.</p>
