  <h1>What matters</h1>
  <p>Family, friends, and the people around you matter. Helping these people matters too. One of the ways I try to help people is through creating software.</p>
<p>But software is only useful if it helps fix a real problem. As a programmer, it is my implicit job to find problems and break down ways to solve them. Here is where many, myself included, get lost.</p>
<p>I get caught up thinking the problem to be solved is a global one. It would be great if I did find a solution to some world-wide issue, but often my effort spent saving the world comes at the expense of local problems I may have the skills to actually fix.</p>
<p>Stop putting the weight of the world on your shoulders. Make a small <em>real</em> difference in the life of a real person. This is the core of empathetic, impactful software development, but it can be applied to many other disciplines.</p>
<p>In summary: 1) help people. 2) be happy.</p>
