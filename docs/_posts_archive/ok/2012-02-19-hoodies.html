  <h1>Hoodies</h1>
  <p>I love them. Hooded sweatshirts, or &ldquo;hoodies&rdquo;, are one of my favorite pieces of clothing. Whenever I get a hoodie, I&rsquo;ll wear it until the fabric is begging to be thrown away. I love the simple colors and pulling the sleeves up when you sit down to type. I enjoy trying to make the drawstrings perfectly symmetrical. Eventually, however, I almost always end up pulling that string out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re versatile, able to be worn through the winter and on cool summer nights. They work well at bedtime, and I often sleep in one when it&rsquo;s cooler. In the morning, putting on a hoodie to drink your tea outside in the sunshine is a great feeling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost certain hoodies were made for runners. Especially during the fall, lacing up a trusty pair of tennis shoes, pulling a hoodie over your head and taking to the road is blissful.</p>
<p>Zip-up, pull-over, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ve always found a sense of comfort when I pull a freshly cleaned hooded sweatshirt out of the dryer. They&rsquo;ll be something I&rsquo;ll always own.</p>
