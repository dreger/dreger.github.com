  <h1>Podcasting Diaries</h1>
  <p>One of my goals for this semester is to start a small podcast. I have always loved public speaking, and I truly enjoy finding the stories of other people. Hopefully this will give me the chance to do just that.</p>
<p>After buying an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VA464S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kyldre-20">awesome microphone</a> [referral link], I spent the first few days just playing with various audio settings and was able to get a feel for how the microphone handles different environments. Next, I came up with some topics I wanted to discuss with a guest, and I set up a time to record. Finally, tonight, I recorded the first episode.</p>
<p>Even though the first show is recorded, edited, and ready to go, I want to get two or three more episodes set up before publishing anything. If everything goes well, you can expect to see an announcement next week.</p>
<p>Having gone through the whole process from idea to production, I have a few notes to share, and will continue to share as I learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the host and guest keep the same distance away from the microphone. My Blue Yeti Mic works great, but there will be a noticeable volume difference unless both parties keep the same distance.</li>
<li>Find a quiet room with decent acoustics. This comes into play if you raise your voice above a certain threshold (you may hear a slight echo), but having a quiet room and a quality mic are two of the best ways to keep the audio clean.</li>
<li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> works great for my purposes right now. For post-production, I found that Normalizing the audio, followed by Amplifying any quiet spots really helped.</li>
<li>It is OK to cut tangents from the recording. At first, I wanted to post an unabridged version of the audio I recorded, but after listening through the first take, I found that some tangents had gone too far off course. Cutting them was painful, but the whole show flows much better now.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t interrupt the guest while they are talking. Even small verbal ticks like &ldquo;mhm&rdquo; or &ldquo;yea&rdquo; are <em>really</em> distracting outside the context of actually being a part of the conversation.</li>
<li>People are interesting. I found my first guest to be entertaining and a lot of fun to talk with, despite not coming from a design or technology background, which were some of the topics we discussed. I found that his unique perspective added a really nice tone to the episode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This first episode was fun, but I know that there are plenty of places I can improve â€” both as a host and a producer. I am still debating over where the podcast will live once ready (on kyledreger.com or its own domain), and I have not yet settled on a name. Nonetheless, I now have one good episode and could not be more excited to record the next.</p>
