  <h1>iA Writer 3.0</h1>
  <p>iA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you came here to read about ground-breaking new features, we have to apologize: iA Writer has not become bigger. It has become lighter, smarter, more refined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a great way to phrase <a href="https://ia.net/writer/updates/ia-writer-3">the changes in this update</a>. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see an app remove features, while still moving towards their original goal: a minimalistic writing experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also happy to see that there is, once again, a single version iA Writer, rather than the Regular / Pro variants they had before. Personally, I found having two versions annoying. Only want to write, iA Writer; have night mode and other editing features, iA Writer Pro. Back and forth. Ick.</p>
<p>Writer 3.0 is an excellent merger of Pro features into the Regular interface, and the new swipe gestures are really nice once you&rsquo;re used to them. Well done!</p>
<p>Also, love the new icon. Emblematic of 3.0 in many ways.</p>
