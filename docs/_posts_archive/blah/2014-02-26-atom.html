  <h1>GitHub&#39;s New Text Editor: Atom</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m in my text editor all day. So when a new player enters the field, I take notice and evaluate what it brings to the table over my current setup. Today, GitHub, the social code-sharing website, announced the arrival of <a href="http://atom.io">Atom.io</a> â€” a text editor they&rsquo;ve been building for <a href="https://twitter.com/defunkt/status/438791340222971904">around six years</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike my current editor (<a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>), Atom is billed as &ldquo;a desktop application based on web technologies,&rdquo; which means that the main interface is driven by a web-rendering engine, unlike most existing text editors today.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Considering that GitHub&rsquo;s main product excels at displaying code <em>in the browser</em>, it makes sense that Atom would continue running with that idea, bringing it to a native application.</p>
<p>Atom is also built to be highly extensible. If you want a feature added to the core, you can build it and submit your package to a centralized repository available to all Atom users. If you&rsquo;ve spent any time with Sublime Text&rsquo;s <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net">Package Control</a>, this concept will be familiar, and you&rsquo;ll be excited that Atom is shipping with a similar implementation.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Also interesting: Atom is being built with tight <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> integration. Node.js is still an area of unfamiliarity for me, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen, it looks to be 1.) really fast and 2.) have a thriving community supporting it. Two very good, important things for this type of software.</p>
<p>Atom is currently invite-only, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting my hands on it. Typically, most of the code I write ends up on GitHub, so seeing how they want a text editor to work is something I find exciting.</p>

<li>Adobe has been working on <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets.io</a>, which uses the same web-rendering approach, but Brackets appears to be geared more towards web developing and web designing. Atom, &ldquo;A hackable text editor for the 21st Century,&rdquo; appears to have slightly larger ambitions.</li>
<li>There are a number of similarities between Atom and Sublime Text that go beyond the Package Control / user-driven repository. The most striking is Atom&rsquo;s interface, which strongly resembles Sublime&rsquo;s. On one hand, there are only so many ways to lay out UI elements for a text editor; on the other, I originally thought &ldquo;Atom&rdquo; was just a new theme and color scheme for Sublime.</li>
