  <h1>I Don&#39;t Need a Popcorn Button</h1>
  <p>Aaron Shekey, a designer and developer living in Minneapolis, recently remodeled his kitchen, which gave him the opportunity to <a href="http://www.aaronshekey.com/posts/the-hot-dog-button/">take a look at the current state of design amid various home appliances</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my frustration I discovered that all I wanted from a microwave was a single knob. That’s it. I want to open a carefully considered door, close it without waking the neighbors, twist a single knob to the desired time, press it to start, and hear a single chime when it’s done. Press again to cancel, or simply twist counter-clockwise to zero it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the crux of Shekey&rsquo;s argument: that most household appliances have let <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature creep</a> go too far. However, I am not sure his solution of a single-knob microwave is the right answer. Perhaps answering &ldquo;why did buttons become popular in the first place?&rdquo; would be a better place to start.</p>
<p>Just from personal observation, I notice that older folks might find buttons easier to actuate, with greater accuracy, than twisting a knob. For them, buttons have a very important <em>practical</em> purpose. That being said, Shekey&rsquo;s definitely on the right track, and I hope to see a follow-up post that further explores this area of design.</p>
