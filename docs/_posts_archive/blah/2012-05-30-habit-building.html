  <h1>Habit building</h1>
  <p><em>Update: this post was written over on a Wordpress blog I had during the summer. Although I migrated most of the posts to my current setup, some are written with the implication that they&rsquo;re still over there - silly things.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to warn you, this will probably be a little rough for the first couple weeks. I typically write longer, thought-out posts over on <a href="http://kyledreger.com/">kyledreger.com</a>, and never felt that short entries should fill the archives. Here, however, the game&rsquo;s changed. I want to get better at writing on a smaller scale, not just when I have 1,500 words in <a href="http://iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a habit. Habits are built day by day, week by week, and more often than not, they don&rsquo;t stick. Consistency is one of the only ways to ensure a habit has time to take root in your life and grow. I can tell some days are going to be like pulling teeth to get up and write, but I need to. If I do, I&rsquo;ll eventually become a better writer and it won&rsquo;t be as difficult.</p>
