  <h1>Sleep and Winding Down</h1>
  <p>Tony Schwartz, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/07/the-secret-to-high-performance/">writing for the <em>Harvard Business Review</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no single behavioral change we’ve seen in our work with thousands of executives that more quickly and powerfully influences mood, focus, and productivity than a full night’s sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schwartz&rsquo;s story revolves around an experimentation with Kevin Crain, a Managing Director at Bank of America, and his sleep schedule. Schwartz also later goes on to cite <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/09/sleep-medical-research">a study at the University of Warwick</a>, which linked a lack of sleep (less than 6 hours a night) to a 48% increase in the likelihood of developing or dying from heart disease. That number, <em>nearly 50%</em>, is unnerving. Sleep and heart health go hand-in-hand far more than I ever thought.</p>
<p>Even more disconcerting, particularly in college, is the powerful and pervasive stigma surrounding any bedtime before 11 p.m. Personally, I have had weeks where 5-to-6 hours of sleep a night were common. My body may be able to handle it now, but forming any sort of habit around this practice is dangerous.</p>
<p>Sleep, and water, are incredibly critical to our overall health. Schwartz talks about a number of benefits that resulted in the tweaking of Crain&rsquo;s sleeping habits, but one of the best tips I took away was this: set a specific time to go to sleep and begin winding down at least 30 minutes before. Most days I make it in bed by 11:30 p.m., but I will have just come from several hours of programming or writing, making it near impossible to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good time to audit our sleeping habits, no?</p>
