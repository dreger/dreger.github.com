  <h1>I lost my iPhone</h1>
  <p>Fun little thing that happened to me today:</p>
<p>Was walking in the library when I went to grab my iPhone, but it wasn&rsquo;t in my pocket. I checked my bag and laptop case, but it wasn&rsquo;t there either. I started to freak out a bit. I didn&rsquo;t have a passcode set and thinking of how many websites it was authenticated with made me sweat.</p>
<p>I quickly went to a computer, logged on to iCloud.com and went to Find My iPhone. I saw a little GPS pin drop on the east side of the library and start moving towards the circulation desk. After marveling at this realtime event, I remotely set the passcode and had it show the message &ldquo;Please call:&rdquo; with my girlfriend&rsquo;s cell phone number. Five minutes later the circulation desk calls her. They have my phone and we walk over to pick it up.</p>
<p>Apple rocks.</p>
<p><em>Special thanks to my girlfriend and her calming demeanor towards what, I&rsquo;m sure, was a very hysterical 19 year old.</em></p>
