  <h1>The Five C</h1>
  <p>Some thoughts on the new iPhone 5C, and why it&rsquo;s going to be the most popular version Apple&rsquo;s ever sold.</p>
<p>One of my favorite iPhones to hold was the iPhone 3GS. In my opinion, it was one of the best-feeling phones Apple ever made. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t appreciate the luxurious feel ushered in with the iPhone 4, I do. But the 3GS felt like, on an ideological level, the everyman&rsquo;s phone. Something simple, sturdy, and able to take a little abuse while still looking great.</p>
<p><em>(The only phones I&rsquo;ve played with recently which gave me that feeling were the Nokia Lumias; sleek, while still maintaining that functional and durable design. I recommend Andrew Kim&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/nokia-lumia-920">review of the Nokia Lumia 920</a> if you&rsquo;ve never seen what the Lumias look like)</em></p>
<p>The iPhone 5C is a return to that idea. Although I have yet to examine the build quality in person, several people have been impressed. David Pierce for The Verge in their <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4714074/apple-iphone-5c-hands-on-pictures-video">hands-on after the Apple event</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to make a plastic phone, though, this is how to do it. From the cohesive shell to the smooth and glossy back (which did pick up a fair number of fingerprints) the device feels far better than Samsung&rsquo;s or LG&rsquo;s plastic options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And John Gruber in his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/iphone_5c_5c_event">Thoughts and Observations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s plastic, but there&rsquo;s nothing cheap about it. It has a far better fit and finish, and feels way better in your hand, than Apple&rsquo;s previous foray into plastic iPhones, the 3G and 3GS. The 5C feels like a premium product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t dislike the color choices available, I plan on getting the white variant â€” possibly with a green (Go Sounders!) case.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I like my gear to be [durable, efficient, and simple]({% post_url 2013-09-09-my-gear %}). I feel the iPhone 5C will fit nicely into that culture.</p>
