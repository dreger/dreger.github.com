  <h1>The Log Podcast</h1>
  <p>Last night, I flipped the switch on my latest project, <a href="/log">The Log Podcast</a> [1].</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t tell you just <em>how</em> excited I am to launch this. Not only has daily readership of the site reached a point where I&rsquo;m comfortable to start branching out into different mediums, but I now have a way of reaching my readers through a medium I have a great passion for: public speaking. For the past few months I had been working out the logistics of getting a podcast up and running, and finally being able to get something out there feels great.</p>
<p>Instead of writing too much more about the show, I would recommend you go listen to the pilot episode. Although my audio occasionally gets a little high (I was excited), the following episodes should fix that issue. Once you&rsquo;ve finished, please do not hesitate to <a href="/colophon">let me know</a> what you think.</p>
<p>Thank you for being with me on the journey so far, and here&rsquo;s to another chapter.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading <em>and</em> listening,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<li>Although I like &ldquo;The Log&rdquo; — it hearkens back to the days of a &ldquo;captain&rsquo;s log&rdquo; — I&rsquo;m still toying with the final name for the podcast. Any thoughts?</li>
