  <h1>New Year&#39;s Habit</h1>
  <p>As I contemplate 2012, less than 12 hours away at this time, I&rsquo;m thinking about the New Year resolutions. While I was thinking, I read a <a href="http://zenhabits.net/fitguide/">post by Leo Babauta on Zen Habits</a> about aiming to create new habits for the new year, rather than setting &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo;. While the article focused on health, there were universal comments about helping to create healthy habits and have them stick. I particularly like this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of creating a list of resolutions this year, create a new habit.
Habits last, and they lead to long-term fitness (and more). They require more patience, but they are worth the wait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changing, or creating, long-term habits are hard. Often times we set unrealistic expectations of what we want to be able to achieve and become disheartened when we can&rsquo;t reach those goals. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t overcome huge obstacles and accomplish great things, but rather we need to be realistic about the journey to get there. A good source of inspiration comes from Matthew 19:26 (NIV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus looked at them and said, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true, just be careful not to change &ldquo;with God all things are possible&rdquo; to &ldquo;with God all things are easy&rdquo;. Change is never easy, but the results and experience along the way are well worth the effort. Be positive, adapt and learn to embrace the journey.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a safe New Year&rsquo;s eve and a great start to 2012.</p>
