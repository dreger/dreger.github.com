  <h1>Dear Ms. Tina Brown</h1>
  <p><em>I tried to sending the following message through the <a href="http://www.tinabrownmedia.com/contact-us/">Tina Brown Media</a> contact form, but the message wouldn&rsquo;t send (I assume it was exceeding the server&rsquo;s maximum number of allowed characters). Nonetheless, the remarks I am addressing took place publicly, so I feel the apology should as well.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Ms. Brown,</p>
<p>Forgive me for using the contact form intended for Women in the World, but I was unable to find any means of contacting you specifically, other than Twitter, which I avoided because of its informal nature.</p>
<p>Just last night, on March 12, you spoke at the University of Mount Union as the guest speaker for their annual Schooler Lecture Series. It was a wonderful evening, and the whole campus appreciated you taking the time to spend a day with us.</p>
<p>I am emailing you to sincerely apologize. Last night, when I got the chance to ask you a question during the lecture (&ldquo;do you plan to expand Women in the World to other areas of international news&rdquo; / &ldquo;where do you stand on the oxford comma&rdquo;), I addressed you as &ldquo;Tina&rdquo; and not, as I should have, &ldquo;Ms. Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warm, friendly nature of the onstage discussion gave me an unintentional assumed familiarity with you, and I am sorry.</p>
<p>Respect and accuracy matters, as you said last night, and I wanted to make sure you know that I regard you as one of the most well-spoken, intelligent individuals in the media today. I have nothing but admiration for your work, and I sincerely hope that my gaffe in public was not taken as a lack of respect towards you or your accomplishments.</p>
<p>I tried to catch you after our short meeting at President Giese&rsquo;s house, but I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to speak with you privately before you left. Nonetheless, I wanted to make sure I got the chance to apologize and to take an extra opportunity to thank you for visiting. I wish you all the luck with the Women in the World Summit this April, and I will be following the coverage in the news closely.</p>
<p>Thank you again,</p>
<p>Kyle Dreger</p>
