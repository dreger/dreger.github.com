  <h1>Eight days without Facebook</h1>
  <p>It&rsquo;s been eight days since [I deactivated my Facebook account]({% post_url 2012-02-02-byebye-facebook %}). After being truly logged out for more than a week, here are a few of the interesting things I&rsquo;ve noticed:</p>
<h3 id="facebook-the-40-minute-hour">Facebook: the 40 minute hour</h3>
<p>This week without Facebook may have been one of the most productive, non-exam weeks of my life. It&rsquo;s not that I was spending an inordinate amount of time on the site to begin with, but taking away the 10-20 minute visits every couple hours has been great. I&rsquo;m getting a whole lot more done.</p>
<h3 id="their-design-kinda-sucks">Their design kinda sucks</h3>
<p>I think while I was actively using the site, I put up with the quirky, inefficient layout because I needed it. Now that I don&rsquo;t, I feel the overall design is flawed. When concepts like <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ias-2006-facebook-designs-redesigned/">Information Architect&rsquo;s idea from 2006</a> exist, it&rsquo;s sad to see Facebook has gotten worse at displaying less information. Every time I look at the screen of someone logged into Facebook, it&rsquo;s like looking at the vomit of a robot who overdosed on blurry pictures and a copy of the Fake AP Stylebook.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-get-yo-number">Can I get yo number?</h3>
<p>My phone address book, sans any Facebook sync, is woefully out of date and incomplete. If I were going to return to Facebook for anything, it would be so I could use the directory of up-to-date contact information on people I actually care to communicate with. This is ignoring the, maybe larger, issue that I can no longer search for people I&rsquo;ve just met. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I relied on Facebook to keep tabs on my friends&rsquo; emails and phone numbers.</p>
<h3 id="im-more-happy">I&rsquo;m more happy</h3>
<p>This is completely subjective, but I feel more happy. I&rsquo;ve started this habit where, when I get bored, I practice coding and work on small side-projects. My old habit would have been opening a browser to check Facebook, but now I have time to do something I actually enjoy and will make me a better programmer. It&rsquo;s about reallocating my time into things that will give me long-term yield.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still adjusting to being outside the Facebook bubble. Like I mentioned, it&rsquo;s rough not having all your friends&rsquo; contact information readily available. However, most of the people I talk to these days go to school with me and are searchable in Mount&rsquo;s online directory. I&rsquo;m curious what another week logged out will show me, especially since it will be over a major holiday.</p>
<p>Short synopsis: I&rsquo;m out and don&rsquo;t have any rationale for going back.</p>
