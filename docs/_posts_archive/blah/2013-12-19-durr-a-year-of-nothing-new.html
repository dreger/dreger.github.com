  <h1>A Year of Nothing New</h1>
  <p>It seems I wasn’t the only one who wanted to mentally, physically, and spiritually start cleaning out the clutter that seems to accrue with time. Sarah Durr, my good friend and future sister-in-law, writing over on her blog <em>Life, Love and Words</em>, says she’s giving up buying anything new for a whole year. This part is my favorite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I started asking myself: What is the reason we own anything other than what we need? The answer isn’t even really because &ldquo;we want&rdquo; but rather simply because we can. Because we have the resources to have not just a home, but one filled with things. And we live in a society where the ability to have things becomes a right, and we forget anything we claim ownership of isn’t actually ours.. Nothing ever is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has been incredibly good to me and to my family. I have never had to experience a day without food, or a night without a place to sleep. As I type this from my personal Macbook, sitting beside the latest iPhone, I am reminded how easily our &ldquo;things&rdquo; can become distractions, separating us from people, nature, and time.</p>
<p>One of Sarah&rsquo;s main examples of spending was the act of buying new clothing; mine would be purchasing new apps. I&rsquo;ve [written about this issue]({% post_url 2011-09-28-appaholic %}) before, and I always struggle with finding a healthy cutoff point — one that lets me still review cool apps but without impulsively buying anything unnecessary. I&rsquo;ll be revisiting my habits in that regard this week.</p>
<p>Regardless, the very fact I am writing these words right now means that I have been given the gift of today. I don&rsquo;t yet have tomorrow, and I should do everything possible to make the world a little better with the time I have right now. That&rsquo;s all any of us have.</p>
