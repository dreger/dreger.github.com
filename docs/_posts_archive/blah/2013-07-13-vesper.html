  <h1>A brief review of Vesper</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve tried tens of iOS note-taking applications over the years. Among others, I&rsquo;ve tested Simplenote, Elements, iA Writer, and Notesy, but none were able to evoke the feelings I get when writing something into my <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> notebook. I was looking for <em>delight</em>.</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a>.</p>
<p>Vesper is a different kind of note-taking application under the mantra &ldquo;Collect your thoughts,&rdquo; and developed by three gentlemen all seasoned in apps and design. Named after a <a href="http://goo.gl/9B5pS">cocktail invented by James Bond</a>, Vesper is every bit as subtle and well dressed as Bond himself. I find myself delighted in the simple animations, speed (like butter on my iPhone 4), and execution of concepts like tagging and archiving.</p>
<p>$4.99 may seem steep for a note-taking app with only a handful of features and no syncing, but go read Dave Wiskus&rsquo;s <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/how-to-make-a-vesper/">post on designing Vesper</a> and you&rsquo;ll see just how much effort was put into nailing the details. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m happy to pay for.</p>
<p>At half the cost for a 3-pack of Field Notes, I consider Vesper an investment in how my brain enjoys working. My only concern is the lack of syncing / iCloud backup, however I&rsquo;m certain that&rsquo;s one feature we&rsquo;ll be seeing eventually. If you love Field Notes, skip the grande coffee today and grab a copy of Vesper instead.</p>
