  <h1>Clymer on the Apple Watch</h1>
  <p>Benjamin Clymer is the founder and editor of Hodinkee, a well-respected voice in the field of wristwatches. I&rsquo;m new to Hodinkee, but it seems I&rsquo;m late to the party. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/fashion/Hodinkee-Wristwatches-Benjamin-Clymer.html">called</a> Mr. Clymer &ldquo;the high priest of horology,&rdquo; and after browsing the site, I can see why: his writing style is clearly expressed and enjoyable, and his perspective astute. But enough about my new favorite website.</p>
<p>Mr. Clymer was invited to the Apple Event a few days ago, and he got time in the hands-on area to assess the Apple Watch.    From his piece, <a href="http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review">A Watch Guy&rsquo;s Thoughts On The Apple Watch After Seeing It In The Metal</a> on Hondinkee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This a question I&rsquo;ve been asked countless times in the media of the past few months ( / days / hours). Will anyone be trading in their Lange Double-Split for an Apple Watch? Certainly not. But, will the average Lange owner buy an Apple Watch, wear it on the weekends, and then, after a great workout with it, decide to leave it on next for a vacation to the beach, and then maybe on casual Friday to the office? It&rsquo;s possible. Apple products have a way of making someone not want to live without them, and while I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully immerse myself in the OS yesterday, what I saw was impressive. So while certainly not direct competition for haute horology watchmaking right now, the Apple Watch is absolutely competition for the real estate of the wrist, and years down the road, it could spell trouble for traditional watches even at a high level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole piece is worth your time. Mr. Clymer also included loads of great pictures from the event, in case you weren&rsquo;t able to see a combination of Apple Watch and strap that you liked. Speaking of the straps, my favorite part of Mr. Clymer&rsquo;s piece was this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple absolutely, positively, indisputably NAILED its straps and bracelets. In addition to offering a bevy of options from leather to fluoroelastomer to link bracelets to Milanese, it is here that you really see how much attention Apple was paying to the way people wear watches, and the how bad existing options were.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me very, <em>very</em> happy.</p>
