  <h1>Amazon&#39;s 30-Minutes-or-Less Delivery by Drone</h1>
  <p>Yesterday, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazons-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/">sat down with Charlie Rose</a> and unveiled Amazon&rsquo;s next big step for their fulfillment centers: delivery by drone in under 30 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: These generations of vehicles, it could be a 10-mile radius from a fulfillment center. So, in urban areas, you could actually cover very significant portions of the population. And so, it won&rsquo;t work for everything; you know, we&rsquo;re not gonna deliver kayaks or table saws this way. [&hellip;] This is&hellip; this is all an R&amp;D project.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: With drones, there&rsquo;s somebody sitting somewhere in front of a screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: Not these; these are autonomous. So you give &lsquo;em instructions of which GPS coordinates to go to, and they take off and they fly to those GPS coordinates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole process is really fascinating and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BIu9dpwHU">the video</a> is even more convincing that this isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> an R&amp;D project; Bezos wants this to be a real system of delivery within the next five years.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re at home on a Friday night and order a Pizza Hut deep dish and that new Xbox game you&rsquo;ve been wanting to try from Amazon. Within 30 minutes of ordering, they&rsquo;ll both be at your door. This is cool.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of situations where an autonomous drone just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> get to places that a person can. Furthermore, there is a whole list of things that could be problematic for drone delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery for apartments</li>
<li>Delivery in the city</li>
<li>Delivery in the rain / wind / snow</li>
<li>Theft of delivery items and / or drones</li>
<li>Legally, what do I have to agree to for a drone to land on my property?</li>
<li>Drone malfunction</li>
<li>Numerous safety issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I assume Amazon won&rsquo;t show you the Prime Air option if your delivery address is outside their drones&rsquo; radius of reach, however will it also be hidden for cases of bad weather and apartment deliveries? Bezos doesn&rsquo;t answer these questions. He does say that the Prime Air project is in an early stage, and that actual delivery-by-drone is still a couple of years away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist [&hellip;] I know it can&rsquo;t be before 2015, because that&rsquo;s the earliest we could get the rules from the FAA. My guess is that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s probably a little optimistic. But could it be, you know, four, five years? I think so. It will work, and it will happen, and it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun or failure? Time will have to tell. I have no doubt that the shipping industry will be disrupted within the next ten years, but I don&rsquo;t know if drones can physically replace the agile and versatile abilities of a person on the scale that Amazon needs for this to be a viable option to most of their customers.</p>
<p>Later on in the interview, Bezos and Rose get into a more introspective discussion about Amazon as a business. Surprisingly, despite Amazon&rsquo;s behemoth presence, Bezos doesn&rsquo;t at all believe that Amazon is invincible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: Companies have short life spans Charlie. And Amazon will be disrupted one day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: And you worry about that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: I don&rsquo;t worry about it &lsquo;cause I know it&rsquo;s inevitable. Companies come and go. And the companies that are, you know, the shiniest and most important of any era, you wait a few decades and they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: And your job is to make sure that you delay that date?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: I would love for it to be after I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delaying the date to inevitable disruption. This is exactly why I&rsquo;m not sold on companies like Snapchat and the next &ldquo;hot&rdquo; startup being worth billions upon billions of dollars: if Amazon, a company that moves millions of physical goods, needs to have a delivery-by-drone R&amp;D project to &ldquo;delay&rdquo; the inevitable disruption, how much less than will it take to disrupt an app that sends pictures to your friends?</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
