  <h1>Goodbye, Facebook</h1>
  <p>It started with one text from my girlfriend. The message read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>byebye facebook</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong words coming from her, but I got excited. Leaving Facebook was an idea I have been toying with for quite a while now, but never had the motivation to actually do. Here now was my opportunity, and I decided to take it it.</p>
<p>There were some real reasons for keeping my profile active, namely that I am the sole admin/developer for several pages and applications. However, after taking some time to transfer ownerships to other individuals (namely our office&rsquo;s &ldquo;social&rdquo; account so I can still do my job), I&rsquo;m free and clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what the effects of not owning a Facebook identity are. Facebook, having become a part of my generation&rsquo;s DNA and about to file for a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/technology/for-founders-to-decorators-facebook-riches.html">record-breaking IPO</a>, it will be weird to watch everything happen from the outside. However, it&rsquo;s about time I started removing some of the things that distract me from real life. Emily and I have a bet that the first one to log back in owes the other dinner, but after only <em>an hour</em> into this hiatus, I don&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;ll ever see a winner.</p>
<p>Sometime&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nice to be outside.</p>
