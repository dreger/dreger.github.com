  <h1>Deleting several online accounts</h1>
  <p>This evening, I <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreger/status/714619719299567616">posted a tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instagram, Snapchat, Foursquare, IFTTT, and Medium all got the axe this past week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the expanded explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong>: This was the most difficult account to close. I joined Instagram the moment they opened registration. I remember looking at terribly faux vignette photos from Jack Dorsey, back when he was in the closed beta. I catalogued most of my college life on Instagram with an iPod Touch. Instagram was reprieve for those who loved photography but hated postproduction. With a swipe and tap, your average photo could look above average. Then things changed. The Facebook acquisition, video, Sponsored Posts, and now, algorithmic timelines. Instagram&rsquo;s values have changed, but mine haven&rsquo;t. The Instagram I loved is dead, and I&rsquo;ve been mourning for about six months too long. Time to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Snapchat</strong>: I rather enjoyed Snapchat, but it got too noisy. The novelty of seeing 50 snaps from someone&rsquo;s completely normal weekday wears off faster than whatever glue Snapchat&rsquo;s using to hold together their sham of a navigational UI.</p>
<p><strong>Foursquare</strong>: Swarm got <a href="https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/swarm-4-0-ui-elements-as-brand-and-brand-as-ui-element-b8ae437a9fb3#.pvptq0gdi">a big update last week</a>, which reminded me that I still have a Foursquare account. After reseting my password, I gave the new Swarm a try, and then remembered how creepy it is to share your location with strangers. I could make my check-ins private, but I have zero friends on the service, so it&rsquo;d just be me.</p>
<p><strong>IFTTT</strong>: The only recipe I ever used would take any new Instagram photos and put a copy in my Dropbox. Considering I broke that recipe when I deleted my Instagram account, I had very little reason to continue being a member. Admittedly, IFTTT&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/03/my_heroic_and_lazy_stand_against_ifttt/">recent squirrely behavior</a> made leaving a little easier.</p>
<p><strong>Medium</strong>: The Gentle Green Giant. I deactivated my Medium account because&hellip; honestly, I can&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s a gut feeling of cynicism, of internal conflict. I want to like Medium. They make it so easy. Custom domains: check. Analytics: check. A method of surfacing interesting content: check. Moreover, Medium&rsquo;s ethos as a sanctuary for writing couldn&rsquo;t be stronger: The President of the United States, Basecamp, and any number of writers I respect are investing heavily in the service. Yet, for every exceptional piece I&rsquo;ve read, there&rsquo;s 30 others that seem to promote the over-the-top, wiser-than-you flavor of narcissism only the deluded self-centered can cultivate — and this crap gets huge traction on Medium. It even <em>looks</em> good on Medium. Strong typography, full-bleed images, mobile ready. When everything looks important, it can be hard to tell what really is.</p>
