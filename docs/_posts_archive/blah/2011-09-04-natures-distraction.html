  <h1>Nature&#39;s distraction</h1>
  <p>My girlfriend and I were recently sitting in the library doing homework when it began to rain outside. The sound of raindrops hitting the roof sounded like a roar of a jet engine right outside the nearby window. A couple of minutes later she asked me if I wanted to see a poem she had written for one of her literature classes. I liked it so much that I asked her for a copy. She graciously agreed and I would like to share it with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s Distraction</p>
<p>Startling pellets of water shoot at the rooftop
First, slow then picking up faster, then louder
Until it makes you stop and look out the window.
The steady build-up of noise,
like the noise of an on-coming train.
In the background, music pouring out of headphones,
secondary to the rain.
My fingers pressing down the keys as I write.
Finally these secondary noises become primary
To the rooftop echo as nature begins to calm.
It is then, I focus on my work,
Until the rain starts again.</p>
