  <h1>Whitney</h1>
  <p><a href="http://www.linotype.com/2090/avenirnext.html">Avenir Next</a> has long been my typeface of choice for kyledreger.com. However, Avenir Next only comes pre-installed on OS X machines, which means that I had to fallback to system fonts for my Windows readers.</p>
<p>As I was working on a typographical refresh of the entire site, I decided that it was time to choose a webfont that would appear the same to <em>all</em> readers, as the font family would be served with the webpage itself and agnostic to the operating system. After looking at a variety of webfont hosts, my search inevitably ended with the renowned Hoefler and Co&rsquo;s <a href="http://cloud.typography.com">cloud.typography.com</a>.</p>
<p>I knew it would end here, too. Some of the most recognizable fonts in the world come from H&amp;Co. ([formerly H&amp;FJ]({% post_url 2014-01-18-hoefler-and-co %})), and I&rsquo;ve been eyeing their library of typefaces for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Next came the difficult part. Avenir Next is a <em>fantastic</em> typeface. It&rsquo;s got a geometric element to it, and the x-height is something I find aesthetically pleasing; finding a replacement font family would be no small task. However, after browsing through all of H&amp;Co&rsquo;s fonts, I couldn&rsquo;t help but fall in love with Whitney: a genuine and simple sans-serif. I find that the crisp and kerned letters — particularly at small font sizes — also helps keep things readable, even at a smaller font size (currently 14px).</p>
<p>I may experiment with a few other typefaces from H&amp;Co, but Whitney does an exceptional job at passing along my unspoken, rhetorical message. For now, I&rsquo;m extremely pleased, and things (literally) look fantastic.</p>
