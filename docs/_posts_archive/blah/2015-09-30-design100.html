  <h1>100 words on design</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m stealing this &ldquo;100 words&rdquo; exercise <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/8577">from Jeremy Keith</a>. It&rsquo;s a fantastic idea, and as Mr. Keith says, &ldquo;when it comes to writing, there are no shortcuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also believe that writing can be a great way to learn. Take any topic, write 10,000 words about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll finish smarter than you started.</p>
<p>For this experiment, I want to spend some time exploring what it takes to design great digital products. Specifically, I want to get better at recognizing what makes good designs good and others not.</p>
<h2 id="001">001</h2>
<p>Bias is the preference of one thing over another. It&rsquo;s the reason some people use iOS and others Android. It&rsquo;s why I favor buying certain types of shoes, and it even influences what I order when we&rsquo;re out for ice cream.</p>
<p>Recognizing your own biases is incredibly important.  Product designers rarely, if ever, design websites or applications for a single user; rather, we&rsquo;re creating something for a wide range of people, each with different personalities, behaviors, and preferences. There&rsquo;s no room for unfounded or blind bias in good products.</p>
<p>I really like the way <a href="https://twitter.com/_bklmn">Joel Beukelman</a> puts it: &ldquo;get bias from experience, not ignorance.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t like big phones, but have never used a big phone, that&rsquo;s ignorant bias. If you don&rsquo;t like big phones because you&rsquo;ve actually <em>used</em> one for a period of time and don&rsquo;t like  how it&rsquo;s difficult to reach the screen corners, that&rsquo;s bias from experience.</p>
<p>Everyone has bias, but it seems the best designers regularly challenge their own assumptions, and they&rsquo;re acutely aware of how their personal preferences may influence a product&rsquo;s design.</p>
<h2 id="002">002</h2>
<p>Users like to know that they&rsquo;re using a product correctly. Knowing this, designers will often use small visual cues to help reaffirm the intended use of their product.</p>
<p>But what about for apps that can be used in many different ways? Periscope is such an example. Periscope lets a user broadcast realtime video from their phone, but once things get streaming, it&rsquo;s hard to know how the user is feeling. Are they feeling self-conscious or confused (like I was, after seeing my face onscreen)? And you don&rsquo;t want the system to pop up a &ldquo;looking good!&rdquo; message if, in fact, they&rsquo;re bombing it.</p>
<p>Periscope handles this by providing the audience with a frictionless method of sending positive, visual feedback during a stream. All the audience has to do is tap on their screen and little, colored hearts will appear. There&rsquo;s no limit to the number of hearts a single viewer can create, so a single person could produce a plethora of visual, realtime feedback for the broadcaster.</p>
<p>Periscope encourages the audience to encourage the broadcaster, which ends up coming across far more genuine than any canned message ever could. It&rsquo;s cute, and it works.</p>
