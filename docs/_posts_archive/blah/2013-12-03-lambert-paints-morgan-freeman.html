  <h1>An iPad Painting of Morgan Freeman</h1>
  <p>Kyle Lambert, a talented visual artist, recently completed, what he&rsquo;s calling, &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s most realistic finger-painting&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently discovered that it was possible to create incredibly high resolution (4k) paintings using only my iPad, and I wanted to see just how far I could push digital artwork and paint a true photorealistic portrait. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The finished painting is made up of around 285,000 brush strokes and took more than 200 hours to complete. The entire process was captured as a time-lapse video by Procreate, allowing you to watch over 200 hours of painting in just 3 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could say that the iPad is incredible for having a touchscreen accuracy that allows for such detail to be achieved.</p>
<p>I could say that iOS is incredible for having so many high-quality applications that facilitate this type of artistic output.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m going to say is that people are incredible, and, given good tools, they can create amazing things. This painting also serves as a box of nails in the coffin of the iPad-isn&rsquo;t-for-content-creation argument.</p>
