  <h1>Buckeye Boys State 2014</h1>
  <p><em>If it&rsquo;s been quiet around here, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been gone for about a 10 days. However, in my rush to leave, I forgot to leave a notice â€” I apologize.</em></p>
<p>Every year, I have the opportunity to work with some of the most incredible individuals I know at the American Legion&rsquo;s Buckeye Boys State (BBS) program. As a counselor, I was in charge of 40 high school juniors, 24 hours a day, for eight days. It was truly incredible to see the changes that occur and the friendships that are formed in just a week. Truly, albeit somewhat corny if you&rsquo;ve never been there, the motto &ldquo;a week to change a lifetime&rdquo; continues to hold true, year after year.</p>
<p>I count myself incredibly lucky to be a counselor at BBS. On staff are not only some of the people I most admire and respect in my life, but also some of my best friends. Now, back to work.</p>
