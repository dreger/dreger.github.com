  <h1>Where Every Story Looks the Same</h1>
  <p>The trend towards big and beautiful online article design is becoming more common. This past year, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/redesign/">went through a large redesign</a>, focusing on bigger type and giving every article a command of the page. Just this last month, Time.com <a href="http://time.com/13113/time-coms-redesign/">did the same</a>, rolling out a new, bigger layout — following the same large-article trend as the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p>Although these new layouts bode well for readability, Felix Salmon, writing for <em>Rueters</em>, argues that the change in design <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/27/against-beautiful-journalism/">removes important visual cues</a> that determine whether an article is important or not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More to the point, news websites have always struggled with any one-size-fits-all approach to stories. A format which works for a 6,000-word feature is not going to work well for a 150-word brief. Web designers have known this for years, but still news sites tend to put all of their stories into exactly the same template — and increasingly that template is designed for ambitious longform storytelling. Which, of course, generally accounts for only a tiny fraction of the material on the site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on, explaining that the new design pulls a bait-and-switch on the reader, ruining expectations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result is a cognitive disconnect: why is the website design telling me that this short blog post is incredibly important, when in reality it’s just a blockquote and a single line of snark? [&hellip;] It’s time for websites to put a lot more effort into de-emphasizing less important stories, reserving the grand presentation formats only for the pieces which deserve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All valid points, but I think Salmon misses the mark.</p>
<p>I would argue that the readers of today don&rsquo;t notice, or care all that much, that all of the <em>Times&rsquo;s</em> articles have the same layout. For a generation that has grown up getting their news on the internet, a literal smorgasbord of different layouts and designs, bigger text and full-width images doesn&rsquo;t always imply importance. Where Salmon calls for the web designs to &ldquo;bring back a little bit of noise and clutter&rdquo; for the sake of visual hierarchy, I would rather do without.</p>

<p>The new designs used by the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Time</em> may not cater to those readers who relied on visual cues to curb their reading. However, the new layouts, from what I can gather, are a strong attempt to make reading experience a priority, regardless of what piece you may be viewing.</p>
<p>In an world where your readers will be using hundreds of different devices to read your content, ensuring <em>everything</em> looks good <em>everywhere</em> is worth the annoyance of change.</p>
