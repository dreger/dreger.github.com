  <h1>The Best Places for Desktop Wallpapers</h1>
  <p>I keep my Mac&rsquo;s desktop immaculately clean. No icons, hide the Dock, and only the essentials in the Menu Bar. This serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>My desktop is always available as a &ldquo;holding place&rdquo; for files I&rsquo;m currently working on.</li>
<li>I get the full screen to display a beautiful desktop wallpaper.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is a personal preference of mine, but the second is something I think everyone enjoys. Over the years I&rsquo;ve whittled down my wallpaper sources to just two places. Both these websites have fantastic selections for your desktop and also include iOS-cropped versions of whatever image you select - if matching device wallpapers is your thing (it is for me).</p>
<h3 id="interfacelift">InterfaceLift</h3>
<p><a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/any/">InterfaceLift</a> has a constantly-updated catalogue of awesome high-resolution photography. Even better, they automatically detect your screen size and make sure the image is big enough to look sharp, not blurry.</p>
<p>My favorite feature is that any image you click &ldquo;download&rdquo; on opens in a new tab; letting you (in most browsers) right-click and choose &ldquo;set as wallpaper.&rdquo; Done.</p>
<h3 id="john-carey-aka-fiftyfootshadows">John Carey a.k.a. &ldquo;fiftyfootshadows&rdquo;</h3>
<p><a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net">Fiftyfootshadows.net</a> has slowly become one of my favorite websites on the internet. John Carey is not just an amazing photographer, see his posts containing <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/category/desktops/">desktop images</a>, but he&rsquo;s also an extremely thoughtful writer. One of my favorite pieces from him is called <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2013/07/15/the-curse-of-expectation/">The Curse Of Expectation</a> — a poignant piece for today&rsquo;s social photographers. If you have a couple minutes, go ahead and read it. I&rsquo;ll wait right here.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, Carey also has a great wallpaper-related post called the <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2012/09/27/iphone-5-wallpaper-pack/">iPhone 5 Wallpaper Pack</a>, which is exactly what it sounds like: 45 hand-cropped wallpapers for the iPhone 5. (iPhone 4/4S? He&rsquo;s <a href="http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2010/08/03/iphone4-retina-wallpaper/">got you covered</a> too.)</p>
<h3 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h3>
<p>Although those two websites mentioned above are where I get 95% of the wallpapers you&rsquo;ll see on my Mac and iPhone, I also check a few other sites from time-to-time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://simpledesktops.com">Simple Desktops</a>: If you like really minimalistic, colorful wallpapers, SD has some of the best.</li>
<li><a href="http://yesterdaywasonly.net">Yesterday Was Only</a>: Unsurprisingly, also by John Carey. However, where Fiftyfootshadows is the curated selection of his photography, YWO is everything else. Not all the images are large enough for a desktop wallpaper, but you can crop them to fit an iPhone pretty well.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://blog.lite.ly">Litely Blog</a>: Images by airplane pilot / photographer, <a href="http://colerise.com">Cole Rise</a>. These images are about the same size as those from YWO, but they&rsquo;re still just fantastic. If you have a smaller screen resolution, you&rsquo;ll be able to use them as-is, but at the very least they look great on a mobile device.</li>
<li>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.twentyfivethree.com/wallpapers/">Bradley Casteneda</a> has some really fantastic wallpapers for your iPhone, iPad, and desktop over on his site. Because all the images are on one page, it can take a little bit to load, but if you love mountain scenery, hang in there — the wait is worth it.</li>
