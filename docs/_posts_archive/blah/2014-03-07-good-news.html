  <h1>Some News from this Week</h1>
  <p>This past week, my school has been on spring break. I&rsquo;ve been catching up on the news whenever I get a chance, but haven&rsquo;t had a chance to do much writing. Nonetheless, here are some of the more choice news stories you should check out, should you have missed them:</p>
<h3 id="the-xp-factor">The XP-Factor</h3>
<p>Peter Bright, in a recent article for <em>Wired</em>, shares that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/weeks-before-expiration-date-windows-xp-still-has-29-os-market-share/">Windows XP still has 29% of the total computer operating system share</a>. Not good news, considering that Microsoft will be dropping support for XP after April 8.</p>
<h3 id="time-magazine-website-redesign">Time Magazine Website Redesign</h3>
<p>Time Magazine has <a href="http://time.com">redesigned their website</a> to feature a more simple, clean layout. I&rsquo;m also a fan of the new &ldquo;Just Posted&rdquo; sidebar on the left.</p>
<h3 id="putt-putt-perfection">Putt-Putt Perfection</h3>
<p>Did you know there is a difference between putt-putt and miniature golf? The latter is what I&rsquo;ve been playing on summer nights for the past 15 years, but the former is a legitament form of competition — sans any clowns or windmill cutouts. Earlier this week, Grantland writer, David Jacoby, <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/putt-putt-perfection/">wrote up a great piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On April 9, 2011, at a tournament in Richmond, Virginia, an IT manager named Rick Baird notched 18 straight hole-in-one shots to record a perfect putt-putt score. In more than 50 years of sanctioned competition, it was just the third time that anyone had achieved the feat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="kant-brew-that">Kan&rsquo;t Brew That</h3>
<p>Interesting news for fans of the Kuerig coffee-brewing machine, manufactured by Green Mountain Coffee. Robinson Meyer for <em>The Atlantic</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Green Mountain Coffee has] historically operated on a razor blade model: Its Keurig business makes real money not by selling machine brewers but by selling K-Cups. Now cheaper competitors have moved in. They sell inexpensive one-off cups and reusable, extensible cups—threatening the company’s business on both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To help fight the reusable-cup market, the next version of Kuerig will <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/soon-our-robot-coffee-baristas-will-only-brew-certain-brands/284193/">only brew your coffee if an actual K-Cup is inserted</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flybook">FlyBook</h3>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> is reporting that Facebook is <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/now-facebook-has-a-drone-plan/">looking to acquire Titan Aerospace</a>, a drone manufacturer. Why would Facebook want drones? The most likely reason would be to help Zuckerberg further his recent efforts with <a href="http://internet.org">Internet.org</a>, which describes itself as &ldquo;a global partnership dedicated to making internet access available to the two thirds of the world not yet connected.&rdquo;</p>
