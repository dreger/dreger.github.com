  <h1>Tobias Frere-Jones is Suing Jonathan Hoefler</h1>
  <p>This news broke yesterday afternoon, but I wanted to let it simmer for a while before commenting. Given that <a href="http://www.typography.com">Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones (H&amp;FJ)</a> is one of the world&rsquo;s best type foundries (their fonts in use by Nike, the Obama campaign, and numerous other national agencies), I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether the headlines about one of the founders suing the other were simply sensational and overreacting to something much smaller.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>If you read the <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=ydQwzs4EZjDkplRrBmkkwA==&amp;system=prod">actual NYC claims document</a>, it becomes immediately clear that Hoefler intentionally broke his promise of giving Frere-Jones a 50% stake in the company. From the claims document (emphasis mine), starting with #13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 . The heart of the proposal was that <strong>Frere-Jones would contribute his name, reputation, industry connections and design authority</strong>, as well as obtain and assign to HTF the rights to certain fonts he had already developed at Font Bureau (referred to as the &ldquo;Dowry Fonts&rdquo;) <strong>in exchange for half of the equity in Hoefler&rsquo;s existing business, HTF</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>14 . A critical part of the creation of the new partnership was that Frere-Jones would &ldquo;have his name on the door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One world-class type designer and one savvy businessman, who were friends, going into business together makes perfect sense. However, things get shady when we skip down to #29:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>29 . After he signed the Sale and Assignment of Type Fonts, <strong>Frere-Jones repeatedly asked Hoefler to complete his part of the bargain and transfer half of the ownership in HTF to him</strong>, and Hoefler repeatedly acknowledged his obligation to do so, but each time begged off purportedly due to the pressures of work or his personal life. As a good partner, Frere-Jones respected Hoefler&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most incriminating sections finish with #42-43:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>42 . On October 21, 2013, for the first time, Hoefler explicitly reneged on his personal agreement to transfer 50% of HTF to Frere-Jones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>43 . Upon information and belief, <strong>Hoefler transferred to his wife, Borsella, the shares that he had promised to Frere-Jones</strong> and Hoefler and Borsella are now the owners of 100% of HTF.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, Hoefler knowingly used Frere-Jones&rsquo; reputation, connections, and fonts, without any intention of giving Frere-Jones his 50% of the company. Magnifying the problem, according to #42, Hoefler gave what was supposed to be Frere-Jones&rsquo; stake to Mrs. Hoefler, letting the Hoeflers own 100% of Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/13141-tobias-frerejones-is-suing-jonathan-hoefler-for-being-denied-a-50-stake-in-their-business">Designers across the web</a> are concerned, not only for the fate of the preeminent type foundry, but also for the company&rsquo;s latest product: <a href="http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/">Cloud.typography</a>; a way to use H&amp;FJ&rsquo;s fonts on websites.</p>
<p>And, according to #49 in the claims document, there is real reason to be concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>49 . Frere-Jones has suffered damage from the breach in an amount to be determined at trial <strong>but not less than $20 million</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a legal situation similar to that when Eduardo Saverin sued Mark Zuckerberg over Saverin&rsquo;s share in Facebook, it&rsquo;s not a stretch to say that nothing good happens when friends sue each other for millions of dollars.</p>
