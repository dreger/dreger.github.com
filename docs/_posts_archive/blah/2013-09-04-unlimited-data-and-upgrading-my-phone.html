  <h1>The Curse of Unlimited Data</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m one of the few lucky Verizon customers who still has an unlimited data plan. However, as I begin to look at possible upgrades for my three-year-old iPhone 4, I find myself in the predicament of getting an upgrade without being forced into a capped data plan.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people in my situation only have two real options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy an unsubsidized, relatively-new device, off eBay or Craigslist and activate my number on it.</li>
<li>Upgrade one of our other eligible lines to a new device and then switch that phone to my line.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although option #2 would save me a little money upfront by subsidizing the price of a phone, it would force whichever line we upgraded to lose unlimited data and be locked into a new two-year contract. Option #1 is currently the only upgrade path for me <em>without</em> having to sign a new contract.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I plan on waiting to see what Apple announces at <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/03/apple-announces-special-event-for-september-10/">their September 10th event</a> and then making a decision from there. If they do release a new iPhone(s?), I can at least look forward to a flood of used iPhone 5s hitting eBay and Craigslist; along with a nice little drop in price.</p>
