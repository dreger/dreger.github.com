  <h1>GoDaddy to File for IPO</h1>
  <p>Telis Demos and Mike Spector for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, reporting on the possibility of <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304914904579439542130264508-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwMDExNDAyWj">a GoDaddy IPO coming later</a> this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Scottsdale, Ariz., company, which provides domain-name registration and website-hosting services to more than 12 million customers world-wide, in the coming weeks plans to interview banks that would lead the underwriting of its IPO, the people said. Based on a typical IPO time frame, the company&rsquo;s shares could begin trading in the second half of the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a web designer and developer, one of the worst decisions you can make is to buy anything from GoDaddy. In my years of buying domains, hosting, and servers, GoDaddy remains the most terrible company I&rsquo;ve ever had to deal with. Each time a client tells me that they&rsquo;ve already bought a domain on GoDaddy, one of the first steps I recommend is to transfer that domain to a service that actually gives a dang â€” like <a href="http://hover.com">Hover</a>.</p>
<p>A deplorable user experience, a leadership that is more interested in using sex to sell their products than actually building good ones, and a never-ending barrage of opt-in services aimed at upselling you every step of the way. Stay away from this one.</p>
