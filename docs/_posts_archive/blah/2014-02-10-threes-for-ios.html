  <h1>Threes!</h1>
  <p>New math-based iOS game from the creators of <a href="http://www.ridiculousfishing.com">Ridiculous Fishing</a>, <a href="http://aeiowu.com">Greg Wohlwend</a> and <a href="http://ashervollmer.tumblr.com/home">Asher Vollmer</a>. Blending math and strategy, Threes! looks incredibly addicting. If you are more of a visual person, I found <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">the trailer</a> does a great job of explaining the gameplay.</p>
<p>Andrew Webster, writing <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/6/5361708/threes-ipad-iphone-puzzle-game">for <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your time in Threes is really only spent doing one thing — adding numbers together to make bigger ones. Yet it remains constantly engaging despite its seemingly simplistic nature. It may be about numbers, but Threes is really a strategy game at heart. In order to get the really big numbers — the ones you&rsquo;ll need to inflate your high score and pose a challenge on the online leaderboards — you&rsquo;ll need to plan at least a few moves ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interesting to read, Ben Kuchera, over on Polygon, has the backstory to Threes! and why it took <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5386200/why-it-took-a-year-to-make-and-then-break-down-an-amazing-puzzle-game">over a year to develop</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They kept trying to add new concepts, new themes and, in some cases, new mechanics. These ideas might have been interesting, but they hid what made the game fun; the simple act of matching numbers in multiples of threes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every time I added anything like that, it always felt unwieldy and unnatural. It just didn’t want to be there,&rdquo; Vollmer explained. &ldquo;Every time I took that stuff out it felt like a good game again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Threes! is, cutely, 33.333333% off for a limited time, which puts it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10ltSa">at only $1.99 on the App Store</a> [affiliate link]. If you like puzzle games in the same vein as <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a> and <a href="http://www.spelltower.com">SpellTower</a>, I have a feeling you are in for a treat.</p>
