  <h1>An Apple a Day</h1>
  <p>Last December, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/apple-meets-with-f-d-a-regulators-for-mobile-medical-applications/">Apple executives met with the FDA to discuss mobile medical applications</a>, perhaps indicative of a growing interest surrounding health-focused devices. Nick Bilton for the <em>New York Times</em> Bits Blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the participants from Apple were Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations; Bud Tribble, vice president of software technology at Apple; Michael O’Reilly, who joined Apple last year; and an employee from Apple’s government affairs department.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some big names from Apple&rsquo;s side to say the least, which, as Bilton describes, means this was probably not a typical meeting.</p>
<p>This story will only increase the fervor surrounding a possible &ldquo;iWatch&rdquo; device, but I think that might be a bit of a stretch. Considering that Apple already has a health-focused device in the game — the iPhone 5s and its <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/10/iphone-5s-includes-new-m7-motion-coprocessor-for-health-and-fitness-tracking/">M7 Motion Coprocessor</a> — it is ostensible that Apple is just looking to better equip itself regarding the regulations and laws surrounding medical technology.</p>
