  <h1>My next Three Books</h1>
  <p>I recently had the opportunity to pick up three books that I had been meaning to buy. I&rsquo;ve rented and borrowed copies of these titles before, but I&rsquo;m happy to finally own them for myself:</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/081296389X"><em>The New York Times Manual of Style</em></a> — If you&rsquo;re trying to do serious blogging, you should be keeping a personal style guide. Style guides are incredibly useful because they help keep your writing consistent. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like the serial comma or if you spell website as two words, just make your <a href="/style-guide">editorial decisions consistent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/020530902X"><em>The Elements of Style, by Strunk and White</em></a> — This book offers a wide variety of practical and technical tips on writing and grammar. I&rsquo;ve seen this title referenced plenty of times throughout my college writing days, and, as a writer, I&rsquo;m almost a little embarrassed that it has taken this long for me to obtain my own copy.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0131103628"><em>The C Programming Language, by Kernighan and Ritchie</em></a> — What <em>The Elements of Style</em> is to writing, <em>The C Programming Language</em> is to programming. Kernighan and Ritchie&rsquo;s book on the venerable C language is legendary for it&rsquo;s pragmatic approach to programming. In addition to being a great reference, this book will also help me to acquaint myself with the &ldquo;low level&rdquo; technology stack, the fundamental base that powers most, if not all, computing devices.</p>
