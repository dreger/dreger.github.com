  <h1>Spoken word &#34;Love&#34;</h1>
  <p>Had an interesting reflection experience.</p>
<p>I felt really inspired after watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bball1989">some of Jeff Bethke&rsquo;s videos</a>. I took this inspiration, along with my Macbook, and went to the BnB cafe. I grabbed a drink, sat down and took some quiet time to clear my mind. What I ended up doing was writing my first “spoken word” poetry piece. I really liked how it turned out, so I got creative and even <a href="http://youtu.be/ZPvXsyCDYs0">made a video</a> for it. It was a really great way for me to reflect; I felt in the zone and was really surprised at how refreshed I felt afterwards. Hopefully this is the start of something new for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstinence is hard / And no, that&rsquo;s not a pun / In fact the fight against temptation / Is the farthest thing from fun.</p>
<p>But He never puts us where / He&rsquo;s knows we can&rsquo;t succeed / Just don&rsquo;t try to fight alone / For only through Him are we freed.</p>
<p>True grace comes from devotion / We have the armor of our Lord / But if you close your heart and ignore His word / You&rsquo;ll fall on your own sword.</p>
<p>So guys, lead with grace / I know she feels like your life / But respect her how you&rsquo;d want another man / to respect your future wife.</p>
<p>Dear Lord keep us joyful / As we go our separate ways / May our minds remain on you / To give you ever-constant praise</p>
<p>Let us be bold for your message / You already paid the cost / Keep our convictions to you strong / When we&rsquo;re surrounded by the lost.</p>
<p>And let us lead them to you / To seek your mercy from above / For leading the lost to Jesus / Is the truest definition of love.</p>
