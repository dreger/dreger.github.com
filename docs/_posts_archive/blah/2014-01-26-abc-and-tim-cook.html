  <h1>ABC&#39;s One-On-One with Tim Cook</h1>
  <p>ABC News has put up <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/apple-ceo-speaks-21660730">a video of their one-on-one interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>. David Muir, ABC&rsquo;s interviewer, and Cook discussed the new Mac Pro, Apple&rsquo;s increasing focus on manufacturing within the U.S., and the government&rsquo;s transparency. Craig Federighi and Bud Tribble made guest appearances in the video, but they were not taped while speaking.</p>
<p>In regards to the government, Cook was adamant that no “backdoor” exists on Apple&rsquo;s servers. He also said that Apple will be pushing congress to be more transparent with data requests for users&rsquo; information.</p>
<p>The video ended with Muir and Cook talking about Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Muir: Steve Jobs said to you, &ldquo;I never want you to ask what I would have done, just do whats right.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cook: &ldquo;By saying what he said, for me, it relieved I believe a huge burden that would have existed had he not said it. And so I think it was incredible for him to do that.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you ever needed a final nail in the coffin of the &ldquo;what would Jobs have done&rdquo; argument, this is it. Jobs wanted Cook to run Apple the way Cook would run Apple.</p>
<p>This video was just the latest of several I have seen that feature, somewhat candid, Apple executives. Jobs tended to be far more reclusive in regards to the media, but I find being able to see the faces that lead Apple and hear their thoughts is satisfying and reassuring.</p>
