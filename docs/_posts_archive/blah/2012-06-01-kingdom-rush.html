  <h1>Great games - Kingdom Rush</h1>
  <p>Upon returning to the apartment this evening, my roommates and I began talking about some of our favorite online games. Back when I was just starting high school and before HTML5 came along, Flash games were me and my friends past time. We spent hours, literally hours, playing some of the classics like <a href="http://dregerkq.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/kingdom-rush/ninjakiwi.com/Games/Bloons-Games/Bloons.html">Bloons</a>, <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/sports-games/miniputt.jsp">Mini Putt</a>, and more. My personal favorite, however, were the tower defense games. From the Wikipedia page for Tower defense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of tower defense games is to try to stop enemies from crossing a map by building towers which shoot at them as they pass. Enemies and towers usually have varied abilities, costs, and ability costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enemies usually travel along a fixed path, and you get to place your towers along the sides. Strategy is of the utmost importance here; you have a limited amount of resources and money to spend on new towers, so you need to make sure that all the paths are covered. Each tower usually has an ability to upgrade its abilities, but all these actions cost extra money. Sometimes it turns out to be a better investment to not upgrade one tower, and instead purchase several less-powerful cheap ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played my fair share of tower defense games. From the cartoon design of <a href="http://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Bloons-Tower-Defense.html">Bloons Tower Defense</a>, to the pixel-geometric <a href="http://criticalthoughtgames.com/geodefense">geoDefense</a>, tower defense games hold a special spot in my heart. However, when my roommates&rsquo; conversation turned to their favorite online games, there was one that stands out in the clear forefront of my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kingdomrush.com/">Kingdom Rush</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Rush is a medieval tower defense game and follows basic strategy as the other; enemies along a path, build towers to defeat them. However, where Kingdom Rush stands alone is in the design and gameplay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exquisitely designed. From the high quality graphics, to the soundtrack and effects, it feels like every pixel was hand crafted by a skilled craftsman. Couple that with the fun animations and “POW!” “WHACK!” that appear above your troops as they battle, and you have a near perfect game.</p>
