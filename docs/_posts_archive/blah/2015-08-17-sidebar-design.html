  <h1>Sidebar design</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m designing a sidebar for a web application, which has a typical header-sidebar-content layout. The header holds the main navigation, the content area has content, but the sidebar has a lot more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two primary action buttons (think &ldquo;create x&rdquo; type).</li>
<li>Two collapsible lists of content (you click the header to collapse the list).</li>
<li>Two lists that are not collapsible.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put a lot in that sidebar, arguably too much. There are too many competing methods of interacting with the content, and it&rsquo;s not clear what the user can actually click. One possible solution would be to have the sidebar serve a more traditional <em>navigation</em> role, but that would uproot our two buttons, which aren&rsquo;t used for navigating.</p>
<p>Everything in the sidebar has to stay for now. Sidestepping the buttons / navigation conflict, the biggest design challenge is creating enough visual distinction between a collapsible list and a list that&rsquo;s static. Right now, we have a small chevron floating to the right of the list title that denotes collapsible functionality. That works OK right now, but the collapsible / non-collapsible list titles look so similar that I&rsquo;m concerned the user won&rsquo;t notice the difference.</p>
<p>Do the lists need the ability to collapse? Yes. The content of each list can get quite long. One possible solution would be to have <em>all</em> lists be collapsible. That would remove the ambiguity, and it would make the interaction with each list header consistent.</p>
