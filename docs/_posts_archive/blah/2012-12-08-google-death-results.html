  <h1>Google death results</h1>
  <p>I was introspective this morning, and found myself Googling about death. I ran across <a href="http://xkcd.com/369/">this comic</a> by xkcd, got inspired and ended up collecting quite a bit of data about the number of search results Google gives back for any given age of death. I&rsquo;ve put those results into a graph for your pleasure, and you can also download the spreadsheet data in <a href="http://cargo.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/2012-12-08-dreger-google-death-results.xls">.xls</a> if you like.</p>

<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>All searches were done from a completely clean Google Chrome (v23.0.1271.95) instance on a Macbook Pro running OS X 10.8.2. Searches were done over Google&rsquo;s SSL.</p>
<p>I used the following query, substituting X for the numbers 10 through 110: <strong>&ldquo;dies at age X&rdquo; OR &ldquo;died at age X&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Then I copied Google&rsquo;s <em>estimated</em> number of possible results - the &ldquo;About 100,000 results (0.25 seconds)&rdquo; part - into a spreadsheet next to the value of X.</p>
<h3 id="notable-numbers">Notable numbers</h3>
<p>There were several notable spikes in the graph for a particular age. Whenever I would get one of these, I&rsquo;d scan the first few results and see if there was one major contributing player and put that name in a third column of my spreadsheet. For some ages (13, 45, and 37) there was a significant number of results, but no single individual I could credit.</p>
<p>The most significant ages were:</p>
<ul>
<li>17 (15,700,000 results) <em>Transplant patient Ollie Green</em></li>
<li>20 (14,100,000 results) <em>Director Bobby Farrelly&rsquo;s son</em></li>
<li>67 (6,910,000 results) <em>State Rep. Yvonne Kennedy</em></li>
<li>82 (5,600,000 results) <em>Astronaut Neil Armstrong</em></li>
<li>84 (3,620,000 results) <em>Singer Andy Williams</em></li>
<li>81 (3,530,000 results) <em>&ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; Star Larry Hagman</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, the ages that returned the least amount of results were:</p>
<ul>
<li>107 (44,600 results) <em>No one</em></li>
<li>104 (194,000 results) <em>Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer</em></li>
<li>108 (223,000 results) <em>Oldest survivor of Auschwitz</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an unconventional way to make a splash in Google&rsquo;s search results, I&rsquo;d recommend being somewhat famous and dying at age 107 or older.</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what put me in an introspective mood this morning, but I spent some time thinking about how short life really is. I thought about how we could go at any time, and that got me searching for various ages of death on Google.</p>
<p>I actually had to start the research over about halfway through my first attempt. The query I used initially left out the word &ldquo;age,&rdquo; which returned lots of items not related to human death. By including &ldquo;age&rdquo; I noticed the results were much more accurate for my goals. If anyone has a better query in mind, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>
