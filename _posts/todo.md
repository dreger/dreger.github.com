![Clear for Mac is nice and simple](http://img.kyledreger.com.s3.amazonaws.com/clear-lists.png)

I've remixed some other models and come up with a simple, elegant process for not forgetting important things I need to do. This system is flexible and doesn't require special software or expensive supplies to work. The principles are effective whether you're using index cards, an app or a text document.  

### 1. Inbox

This is where I put everything on my mind that needs some sort of action. Emails to write, school assignments - this list acts as a catch-all for anything and everything. 

I make sure to put the fun, less tasky, things in there too. If you only keep track of the un-fun stuff you need to get done, you'll resent the whole system. Having items like "Surprise kiss Emily" and "Take five minutes to reflect" keep me enthusiatic. 

### 2. Today's focus

Once everything has been thrown into **Inbox**, I pick out the few things I want, or need, to accomplish today and move them to this list. I typically leave this list open so I can quickly check it throughout the day.

Remember, **Today's focus** is what everything you want to get done today, not everything you want to get done. 

### 3. Email ###

I get *a lot* of email. The sheer volume warranted, at least for me, it's own separte list. The format of the items here are simple:

> Re: Sarah - Logo design  
> Write Chris - New iPad game
