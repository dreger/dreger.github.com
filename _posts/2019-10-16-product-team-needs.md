title: Hierarchy of Product Team Needs
---

I was on a run and thinking about [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) and how it could apply to product teams. I looked online, but all existing "product hierarchy of needs" info-graphics weren't what I was looking for, so I made my own: 

[![pyramid of needs]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/pyramid.jpg)](/assets/images/pyramid.jpg)

Let's walk through the levels. 

**Level one: daily conversations with the customer.** At level one, a product team needs to be talking to customers. No way around it. If you don't have access to or reach out to customers, I have zero faith you can build any sort of product that will work. 

**Level two: quickly build and share prototypes.** Level two is where we jump to acting on the feedback we get from the customers we're talking to. A good product team should be able to quickly create prototypes and mockups (code, Figma, whatever) that are Just Enough™ to demonstrate value and begin to find usability issues. These should be lightweight and fast to create. If they're not, you have problems. These prototypes should be shareable with a single link. 

**Level three: lightweight metrics.** Level three is where we can get into a rabbit hole of products and terms and general misdirection about what you truly need. For me, a maturing product team needs some form of analytics and metrics. You do not, I repeat DO NOT, need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to spend two months integrating with one of the huge product analytics players out there—your needs at this point are way simpler. Metrics usually involve two questions: (a) what should we track and (b) how can we report on it. For (a), basic things like page views, clicks, and lower level database fields can indicate usage (have they turned on feature X? set a date field with the date they turn it on). For (b), you either need to have access to the database and some knowledge of SQL (it's not hard to get the basics) or a tool that simplifies it for you. There are lots of tools, just be extremely judicious about giving database access to a third party

**Level four: process for team self-improvement.** Ding. Welcome to level four. At this point, you should have enough of a flow in the create->ship->research cycle to actually identify broader issues across multiple teams. The problem is if you don't actually set aside time for growth or reflection, you're never going to improve. People will leave, and you'll find yourself sliding back down the pyramid. These can be as simple as having design reviews for the designers, a book club where everyone reads a different book and reports on what they liked, or retrospectives on outcomes you either did or didn't deliver. 

**Level five: formal-ish delivery, release, and marketing ops.** Level five is the last one I could think of, and it's all about making sure the people you've got doing the things on the bottom four levels are able to spend as much time as possible on those bottom three things. Once you reach a certain size, I think having a team or members of the team assisting in the delivery, release, marketing, and support of the things you're shipping can be a big time saver—and it's a thing that's ripe for operationalizing. So much so our industry has actually given it a name: product ops. Regardless what you call it, it's the acknowledgment that if you want product people talking to customers, creating prototypes, and looking at the data, then anything they do that aren't those things is hurting those core layers of the pyramid. 

I'm certain this isn't one-size fits all. But in general, I think if you've got people pouring time into one of these levels without an equal or greater amount of effort going into the level below it, you're wasting time.
