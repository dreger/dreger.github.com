Safari's Web Inspector [turns 10 this week](https://webkit.org/blog/5718/10-years-of-web-inspector/). Web Inspector turned every website into an interactive blueprint, and I spent hours exploring all the code that powered my favorite websites. Having access to that information was instrumental in me getting started with web design.
