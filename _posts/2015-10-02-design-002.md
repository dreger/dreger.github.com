Bias is the preference of one thing over another. It's the reason some people use iOS and others Android. It's why I favor buying certain types of shoes, and it even influences what I order when we're out for ice cream.  

Recognizing your own biases is incredibly important.  Product designers rarely, if ever, design websites or applications for a single user; rather, we're creating something for a wide range of people, each with different personalities, behaviors, and preferences. There's no room for unfounded or blind bias in good products. 

I really like the way [Joel Beukelman](https://twitter.com/_bklmn) puts it: "get bias from experience, not ignorance." If you don't like big phones, but have never used a big phone, that's ignorant bias. If you don't like big phones because you've actually _used_ one for a period of time and don't like  how it's difficult to reach the screen corners, that's bias from experience. 

Everyone has bias, but it seems the best designers regularly challenge their own assumptions, and they're acutely aware of how their personal preferences may influence a product's design.
