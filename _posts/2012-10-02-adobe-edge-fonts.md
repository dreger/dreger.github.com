There are some seriously great web fonts now available through Adobe at [edgefonts.com](http://www.edgefonts.com/). Unlike TypeKit, where you have to register an account to use the service, Edge only requires one line of Javascript to start using the font family in your CSS. 

Google’s been doing [something similar](http://www.google.com/webfonts) for a while now, but I’ve found that using typefaces from Adobe is both faster and of higher quality than what Google has to offer. If you run your own site, you should definitely invest some time finding the perfect typeface to complement your content.
