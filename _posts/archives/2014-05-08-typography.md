[Avenir Next](http://www.linotype.com/2090/avenirnext.html) has long been my typeface of choice for kyledreger.com. However, Avenir Next only comes pre-installed on OS X machines, which means that I had to fallback to system fonts for my Windows readers. 

As I was working on a typographical refresh of the entire site, I decided that it was time to choose a webfont that would appear the same to _all_ readers, as the font family would be served with the webpage itself and agnostic to the operating system. After looking at a variety of webfont hosts, my search inevitably ended with the renowned Hoefler and Co's [cloud.typography.com](http://cloud.typography.com). 

I knew it would end here, too. Some of the most recognizable fonts in the world come from H&Co. ([formerly H&FJ]({% post_url /archives/2014-01-18-hoefler-and-co %})), and I've been eyeing their library of typefaces for quite a few years. 

Next came the difficult part. Avenir Next is a _fantastic_ typeface. It's got a geometric element to it, and the x-height is something I find aesthetically pleasing; finding a replacement font family would be no small task. However, after browsing through all of H&Co's fonts, I couldn't help but fall in love with Whitney: a genuine and simple sans-serif. I find that the crisp and kerned letters &mdash; particularly at small font sizes &mdash; also helps keep things readable, even at a smaller font size (currently 14px). 

I may experiment with a few other typefaces from H&Co, but Whitney does an exceptional job at passing along my unspoken, rhetorical message. For now, I'm extremely pleased, and things (literally) look fantastic.
