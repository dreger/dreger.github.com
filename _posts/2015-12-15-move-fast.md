VMG: 

> Anyone who has worked on a large enough codebase knows that technical debt is an inescapable reality: The more rapidly an application grows in size and complexity, the more technical debt is accrued. With GitHub's growth over the last 7 years, we have found plenty of nooks and crannies in our codebase that are inevitably below our very best engineering standards. But we've also found effective and efficient ways of paying down that technical debt, even in the most active parts of our systems.

Great point.
