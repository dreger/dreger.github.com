Over the past two months, I've been linking to various articles, apps, and items that I've thought my readers would enjoy. However I've noticed that the amount of commentary I've been adding to each linked item has been dropping &mdash; this is not something I want. 

To counter this trend, the linked items will be taking a different form over the coming weeks. Firstly, I'll be renaming the linked items to "excerpts" &mdash; something I've [unashamedly borrowed](http://randsinrepose.com/links/2013/11/14/rands-in-rss/) from Michael Lopp of _Rands in Repose_. Secondly, I'm going to try and make each excerpt follow along these guidelines (also borrowed from Lopp): 

- Be short.
- Add original commentary â€“ don't be simple links or quotes to other articles.
- Appear more frequent than the long form posts.

Although this adds a new level of writing to my current load, I think it will be manageable by dropping my post-per-day goal down to just a single entry a day. 

Hopefully this change keeps fresh stories on the site and allows me to keep the quality of each item high. It will be interesting to see how this experiment goes given the impending exam week, but I feel confident that this will be a long-term change for the best.
