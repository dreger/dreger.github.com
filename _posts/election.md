We start in Bamash
Home of the iMoos
A democratic people
And they all love to vote

The town's pretty quiet
Almost all of the year
Except come elections
Then that's all we hear

"Vote for me!" hopefulls shout
Up and down every street
"I'll make your life better"
To every voter they greet

Each year it's the same
Come November it starts
Every politician campaigns 
To win the most hearts
