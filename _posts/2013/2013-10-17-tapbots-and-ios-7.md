When iOS 7 was announced, it instantly made most of the apps in the App Store look old and outdated; apps that had previously made heavy use of graphics and images looked out of place in contrast to iOS 7's flatness.

One of my favorite app developer teams, [Tapbots](http://tapbots.com), was hit particularly hard by the iOS 7 announcement. Over the past several years, the Tapbots team, Mark Jardine (design) and Paul Haddad (code), had built a company by designing highly-customized user interfaces for their applications. I was curious how they'd respond to the changes.

In an [interview with _Macworld_](http://www.macworld.com/video/26841/paul-haddad-on-tweetbot-and-calcbot.html) following the announcement of iOS 7 at Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), Haddad made the following comments:

> I don't think we have to match exactly what's there [in iOS 7], but we definitely have to take some of the cues that, you know, they're giving us.
>[...]
> Today might kind of throw everything up in the air, because we'll have to go back and look at how much we're going to change.

By far, Tapbots most popular app is Tweetbot; a powerful Twitter client that lets you easily manage multiple accounts, view conversation threads, and is also my personal favorite . After WWDC, Tapbots had remained particularly quiet about any progress, and Tweetbot was looking older with every passing day. However, this past Thursday, Jardine gave an [update on the company blog](http://tapbots.com/blog/business/tapbots-and-the-state-of-our-apps-in-ios7) regarding the past few months:

> Playing with the beta of iOS7 over the next few weeks brought us to the realization that this would not just be a "re-skin". We really had to just start over with the new foundation and concepts of iOS7.

> [...]

> We've been working night and day for the last 4 months to re-design and develop an app [Tweetbot] that took over a year to build. The good news is that we are extremely happy with the results and can't wait to share it with everyone.

According to Jardine, Tweetbot 3 has been submitted to the App Store and is awaiting approval. Like I've said before, [great software takes time]({% post_url /2013/2013-10-02-paying-for-software %}), and I can't wait to see what Tapbots has spent the last four months building.
