Some thoughts on the new iPhone 5C, and why it's going to be the most popular version Apple's ever sold.

One of my favorite iPhones to hold was the iPhone 3GS. In my opinion, it was one of the best-feeling phones Apple ever made. It's not that I don't appreciate the luxurious feel ushered in with the iPhone 4, I do. But the 3GS felt like, on an ideological level, the everyman's phone. Something simple, sturdy, and able to take a little abuse while still looking great.

_(The only phones I've played with recently which gave me that feeling were the Nokia Lumias; sleek, while still maintaining that functional and durable design. I recommend Andrew Kim's [review of the Nokia Lumia 920](http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/nokia-lumia-920) if you've never seen what the Lumias look like)_

The iPhone 5C is a return to that idea. Although I have yet to examine the build quality in person, several people have been impressed. David Pierce for The Verge in their [hands-on after the Apple event](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4714074/apple-iphone-5c-hands-on-pictures-video):

> If you're going to make a plastic phone, though, this is how to do it. From the cohesive shell to the smooth and glossy back (which did pick up a fair number of fingerprints) the device feels far better than Samsung's or LG's plastic options.

And John Gruber in his [Thoughts and Observations](http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/iphone_5c_5c_event):

> Yes, it's plastic, but there's nothing cheap about it. It has a far better fit and finish, and feels way better in your hand, than Apple's previous foray into plastic iPhones, the 3G and 3GS. The 5C feels like a premium product.

Although I don't dislike the color choices available, I plan on getting the white variant &mdash; possibly with a green (Go Sounders!) case.

At the end of the day, I like my gear to be [durable, efficient, and simple]({% post_url /2013/2013-09-09-my-gear %}). I feel the iPhone 5C will fit nicely into that culture.
