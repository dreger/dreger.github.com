My first book will be [_A Grief Observed_][1], by C.S. Lewis.

I haven't even started the book, but I already know that it's going to make me sad. I guess it's unfair to expect anything titled "A Grief Observed" would be happy in nature, but still. I think it makes me nervous to see what C.S. Lewis' clear, honest writing style does to the topic of grief, something that I'm still dealing with. I secretly hope that this text will help enlighten or explain some of the very feelings I continue to observe.

The introduction to "Grief Observed" is written by Douglas H. Gresham, the stepson of Lewis, who Gresham refers to as "Jack." I assume that Jack was the close-friends-and-family name for Lewis, although I wasn't able to find much online to support this. Nevertheless, Greshman sets the context, and we're given a glimpse at how much Lewis loved his wife, Helen Joy Gresham.

Gresham is no slump writer, and I'll pretend that he learned a lot about clarity and style from his stepfather. One passage in particular stuck out (emphasis mine):

> This book is a man emotionally naked in his own Gethsemane. It tells of the agony and the emptiness of a grief such as few of us have to bear, for the great the love the greater the grief, and **the stronger the faith the more savagely will Satan storm its fortress**.

The imagery here is painfully clear. The reference to Christ's night before his crucifixion, the image of Satan literally storming our bastions of faith. Powerful.

The introduction leaves me more excited, and nervous, to start this book. I'll write up my thoughts on Chapter One next, but I already snuck a peak at the first line: "No one ever told me grief felt so like fear." Time to start.

## Chapter One


> But her voice is still vivid. The remembered voice&mdash;that can turn me at any moment to a whimpering child.

Over the past two weeks, I've consciously tried to remember my mother. What she would wear. How she would act. Yet despite having physical pictures that help sharpen the image in my mind, I was finding it  near impossible to remember her mannerisms. Explaining this distress to my wife, she quickly launched into an impromptu performance of how my mother would greet and hug us at the door. The memories came flooding back, and I was happy to hold them close, if only until they began to fade again.

And here is where Lewis' first chapter of _A Grief Observed_, which I'll be referring to as GO for the remainder of this series, spends most of its time: examining the terrible speed at which memories of our loved ones can become unfocused.

_Aside: I find it both sweet and saddening that Lewis refers to Helen as H in his writing. It evokes images of notes left to one another in the early morning, of a lifelong dialogue where the frequency and intimacy was more efficient and enjoyable without those four extra letters._

In the days and weeks after shock has worn off, Lewis writes about how easy it is to allow mood to become the memory. He warns against allowing the "wishes of the dead" to be taken too seriously, fearing that the sentiment might become a crutch. And while I feel that keeping the deceased in our everyday conversations ("Mom loved this type of food," "Remember that time when Mom.."), becoming too comfortable with phrases like, "Mom wouldn't have liked" can be misused, as Lewis puts it, like "an instrument of domestic tyranny."

As I read, I find myself walking side-by-side with Lewis. He explains feelings I'm familiar with. However, our paths diverged about halfway through this chapter:

> To some I'm worse than an embarrassment. I am death's head. Whenever I meet a happily married pair I can feel them both thinking, 'One or other of us must some day be as he is now.'

I'm the young man in that illustration. My mother died days after my engagement, and what followed was a firsthand account at the emotional turmoil that would become my own should my then-fiancee die. It was terrible, and the loss of my mother only magnified the effect. Sadly, Lewis' interpretation of his affect on the young couple is accurate.

As I near the end of the chapter, Lewis addresses some thoughts that I've had myself. He writes about how difficult it is to have patience with people who try to refute the pain of death by downplaying its reality. But that's simply not the case. The absence of my mother, her hugs, her voice, her texts; those are all real, and they will never come back. One could get away with saying "there is no death," framed against the image of Heaven, but the truth is that death, in the context of our non-heavenly world, is absolute. Lewis:

> I look up at the night sky. Is anything more certain than that in all those vast times and spaces, if I were allowed to search them, I should nowhere find her face, her voice, her touch? She died. She is dead. Is the word so difficult to learn?

## Chapter Two


> I say their landfall, not their arrival.

The tone is so dark. Yet honest. Yet correct. Lewis deals with more input from the people around him. How his wife is. Where she is. What she's doing. All these conjecture and speculations. None of them biblically founded, and all of them illustrated as such to paint heaven as merely the comfortable reflection of our lives and memories lost here on earth. But that ant be right. Heaven can't be the same as on earth, or can it? Will we have the things we enjoyed on earth in heaven? Will marriages hold their earthly relevance once were on the skies?

Lewis also deals with the growing concern that his memories of H. will transform into idealistic fiction. "The reality is no longer there to check me," Lewis writes.

> Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief.

Lewis doesn't lay off on the imagery. From personal experience, there's something about loss that makes eloquence through imagery easy.
