Users like to know that they're using a product correctly. Knowing this, designers will often use small visual cues to help reaffirm the intended use of their product. 

But what about for apps that can be used in many different ways? Periscope is such an example. Periscope lets a user broadcast realtime video from their phone, but once things get streaming, it's hard to know how the user is feeling. Are they feeling self-conscious or confused (like I was, after seeing my face onscreen)? And you don't want the system to pop up a "looking good!" message if, in fact, they're bombing it. 

Periscope handles this by providing the audience with a frictionless method of sending positive, visual feedback during a stream. All the audience has to do is tap on their screen and little, colored hearts will appear. There's no limit to the number of hearts a single viewer can create, so a single person could produce a plethora of visual, realtime feedback for the broadcaster.  

Periscope encourages the audience to encourage the broadcaster, which ends up coming across far more genuine than any canned message ever could. It's cute, and it works.
