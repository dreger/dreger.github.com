I just made my first camera lens in Adobe Illustrator. Following the awesome [tutorial from Tuts+](http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustration/create-an-aperture-style-camera-lens-icon/), it took me about two hours to complete. I've got lots of improving to do, but I've always wanted to learn how to make something this intricate and downright cool. 

Illustration is a world I've long looked at, but never really entered into like I did with web design. I want that to change this summer. After only spending two hours working with Illustrator, I realized have a passion for this type of design. Being able to create *anything* I can think of makes me excited. I've always loved looking through the recent submissions to [dribbble](http://dribbble.com), a design-centric social network, and maybe one day I can be a member there. 

I've long believed that, with enough effort, you can learn practically anything with the Internet. Hopefully by the end of this summer, I will be a much better illustrator than I am now, and have a rekindled passion for drawing.
