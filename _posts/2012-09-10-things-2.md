About a year ago, I bought [Cultured Code's](http://culturedcode.com) Things task manager for my iPhone. I liked it, but having a way to add tasks while on my Mac was crucial. I downloaded a demo of their Mac client, but there was no way to sync the two apps. Keeping two different lists in sync manually was ridiculous. I walked away from Things for a while. 

Fast forward to today. CC recently released Things 2 for Mac, iPhone and iPad. The biggest new feature? Things Cloud sync. It's brilliant, and just works. But, more importantly, it's ridiculously fast. I went ahead and bought the Mac app.

I don't know how I'd manage my school, club and life todos without Things. The workflow fits my simple mindset. I start the day by putting everything on my mind in the Inbox. Once everything's in there, I pick the ones I want to do, and star them for Today. Everything has a place, and every place has its things.
