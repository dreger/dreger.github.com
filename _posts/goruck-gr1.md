The GORUCK GR1 is the best bag I've ever owned. I will own it for the rest of my life. 

Calling something the best has inherit danger. Obviously, what may be the best to me, may not be the best to you. Many of the criteria we judge our things on is subjective, adding even more danger when we proclaim anything to be **the best**. 

That being said, I believe I have found the best backpack out there. It comes in the form of GORUCK's GR1. This is a serious bag, and it comes with a serious price. At $295, you're not going to be getting this as Christmas presents for your friends, but as an investment for a lifetime it's completely worth it.
