I've officially checked off the last of the Big Three Birthdays. 16 (driving privileges) DONE, 18 (I'm a man) DONE, and 21 (official adult in full capacity) DONE. I am a fully-operational citizen with all the rights granted from the Constitution and herein and so forth, etcetera, etcetera.

<small>Much love to Emily for the awesome USA centennial jersey</small>

And yet, I can't help but feel nothing's different. 

Perhaps because nothing is.
