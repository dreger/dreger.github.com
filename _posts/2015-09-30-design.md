I'm stealing this "100 words" exercise [from Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/8577). It's a fantastic idea, and as Mr. Keith says, "when it comes to writing, there are no shortcuts." 

I also believe that writing can be a great way to learn. Take any topic, write 10,000 words about it, and I bet you'll finish smarter than you started. 

For this experiment, I want to spend some time exploring what it takes to design great digital products. Specifically, I want to get better at recognizing what makes good designs good and others not.
