You can tell a lot about a person by looking at how they set up their home screen and apps. This is mine as it currently stands on my iPhone 4:

My home screen is a little more sparse than others, but this allows me to quickly get on and off my phone [without getting too distracted]({% post_url 2013-09-26-kraus-distraction %}).

### The Home Screen

- The wallpaper is courtesy of [Bradley Casteneda](http://www.twentyfivethree.com/wallpapers/), who has some real beautiful shots that fit perfectly with iOS 7.
- I have a three-icon dock. Four down there feels too crowded, and two feels like I'm sacrificing usability for the sake of minimalism. Three feels just right.
- I no longer keep Camera or Clock on the first page, they're now tucked away in a folder for misfit apps. Because both are easily launched from Control Center, just a swipe away _in any app_, it was hard to justify them taking up space.
- My apps are arranged in alphabetical order on two planes: the first page and then the dock.
- I have no more than two pages of apps at a time. The second page isn't anything special, just two folders: one for apps I use, and one for apps I don't, but can't get rid of.

### My Apps

My app selection is small, but it works for me.

- App Store: I'm constantly trying out new apps that have unique interfaces, or really great implementations of common ones. I also like to read the "What's new" notes whenever one of my apps gets updated.
- Bible: YouVersion's Bible isn't the fastest of the Bible applications I've tried, but it is the best. Plus, the notes and highlights I make in the app sync to their web interface ([bible.com](http://bible.com)) so I can read and study wherever I want.
- Messages: I'm in love with the new Messages interface for iOS 7. It's fun, colorful, and beautiful. The only thing that could be improved would be [the emojis](https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/381219337534595072). _Fun tip: when in a message thread, swipe right-to-left to see the timestamps for each message._
- Newsstand: I use to absolutely loathe Newsstand. I didn't ever download magazines, much less read them on my iPhone. However, after seeing how well designed The New York Times iOS 7 app was, I've really started to enjoy having high-quality news just a tap away for my daily lunch.

_Students: The New York Times (among others), offers a huge discount to subscribers if you have a .edu email address. I'm currently on their $.99-for-four-weeks promotion, but I plan on sticking with them through the end of this year. Check out [The NYT's education discount page](http://homedelivery.nytimes.com/HDS/CMHome.do?mode=CMHome&CampaignCode=393W8) and remember to always ask about .edu discounts when shopping for software or subscriptions._

- Photos: The best camera is the one you have with you. My iPhone has captured so many precious memories of my life that I love having quick access to the most recent ones.
- Safari: Without a doubt, one of my favorite apps on iOS. When the iPhone was first released, Safari was the first browser to offer _real_, modern web browsing for mobile devices. It's only gotten better with iOS 7, and will always have a place on my first page.
- Settings: Control Center does 80% of what I typically need Settings for, but I access the other 20% (wallpapers, email settings, check data usage) too often to not have them readily available.
- [You Need A Budget](http://www.youneedabudget.com) (YNAB): This app has singlehandedly helped me get my finances under control and create a sustainable, responsible budget. The effect has been profound. I'm absolutely in love with this app, and am looking to do a full review once I've been using it a couple more months.
- Calendar: I live and die by my calendar. The basic rule of thumb is: if it's not on there, I'm not going to it. One particularly useful part of both my fiancee and I having iPhones is that we can share a "wedding" calendar &mdash; so we're both aware of important dates.
- Mail: I really don't get that much personal email, but I do get a ton for school. However, to help keep it from overwhelming me, I set the app to only check for new messages every half-hour, and I removed the unread message count badge. Now I check my email when I have time, not when it tells me to.
- Vesper: This is [where I collect my thoughts]({% post_url 2013-07-13-vesper %}). It's delightful, simple, and looks great to boot. If you have any appreciation of Field Notes or small caps in typography, [go check it out](http://vesperapp.co).

That's it. Each app has been specifically chosen because it's the best at what it does for me. Have a cool home screen or app you really love? I'd love to [hear about it](mailto:comments@kyledreger.net).
