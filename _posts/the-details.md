I obsess 

I've grown up obsessing over details. A pixel too wide there, the margins need to be closer here. Scrutinizing detail after detail until it's achieved my personal definition of perfect. This was a never ending process. I'd create something new, polish it until I thought it was fit for finish, and put it out in the wild. Two weeks later, sometimes less, I'd be back and completely hate the border on that button, the color of the links and the line height. Endless damning of my own design. 

Over the years, this began to build a sort of festering anger in me towards my own work. I loved the rush of starting a new project, but I loathed the decisions I made along the way; knowing I'd be back to change them. This bled into my own life in various ways. I can't tell you the number of email addresses I've had, or the different variations of my name I've used for domains. Always trying to make them shorter, more memorable, more real, more anonymous. Different.
