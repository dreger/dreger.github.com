Tapbots recently released Appbot, a mobile iOS client for App.net. While this is a new app, it's design is basically Tweetbot, but with App.net on the backend. 

I put together a little list of details I found that might have been missed: 

1. Welcome screen

When you first run Appbot, and add an account, you are greeted with a small welcome / tutorial window. However, this window welcomes you to Appbot with the Tweetbot logo.

There is also an issue with the "Customizable Tab Bar" section of the tutorial as well. Currently in Appbot, the middle icon on the tab bar is a link to your profile. However, in the tutorial, you see a link to Direct Messages like in Tweetbot. Also, when you hold down on one of the customizable parts of the tab bar, the only swappable button is your muted users. No lists, or reposts screen yet.
