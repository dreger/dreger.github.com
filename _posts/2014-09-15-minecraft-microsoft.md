Microsoft has [acquired Mojang](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/sept14/09-15news.aspx), the company behind Minecraft:

> The Mojang team will join Microsoft Studios, which includes the studios behind global blockbuster franchises “Halo,” “Forza,” “Fable” and more. Microsoft’s investments in cloud and mobile technologies will enable “Minecraft” players to benefit from richer and faster worlds, more powerful development tools, and more opportunities to connect across the “Minecraft” community.

> Microsoft plans to continue to make “Minecraft” available across all the platforms on which it is available today: PC, iOS, Android, Xbox and PlayStation.

Notably lacking: Windows Phone.

Every single kid in my sister's middle school knows about, if not plays, Minecraft [1]. This acquisition feels very similar to Yahoo buying Tumblr: a grab at the next generation of digital users. Except, unlike Tumblr, Minecraft has managed to infiltrate the lives of those pre-teen and younger.
