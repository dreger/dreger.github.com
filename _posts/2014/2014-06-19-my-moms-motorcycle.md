title: My Mom's Motorcycle
  
---


Douglas Gautraud: 

> This is a short film about how my mom became the owner of a motorcycle for the My Rode Reel competition. More deeply it is about how people use objects to connect with times, ideas, and people. 

Polished, funny, and creative non-fiction storytelling at its very finest.
