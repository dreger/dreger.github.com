# Identity

This post has been sitting in my drafts for longer than I can remember. Identity is something that I personally struggle with - something I can't ever seem to settle on. And it's a problem that has only increased as I sign up for different services, with different usernames and differnet ways to represent myself. It's become overbearing. 

It started when I was young. When I got my first email address @aol, I took forever creating a screen name. Just my name, or something cool like all my then-middleschool friends. I took forever deciding. 

That didn't stop once I got old enough to register for different online services. It felt like every website wanted you to pick another username, another profile picture, and another bio. I began to feel the stress.
