I've been using Typekit to serve up the fonts you see here on [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com) and have been very pleased. Normally, when you want to use a custom font on your website, you need to make sure it's a font that your visitors need to have installed on their machines. If they don't have that particular font, their browser will revert to using a default, and ugly, backup. 

However, Typekit lets you use any font you want, even if the visitor doesn't have it installed! Even with the most basic free plan, you still get access to plenty of great fonts and the speed is fantastic. 

As much as I love Helvetica and Georgia, I can't get enough of the PT Sans that I'm currently using. Such a great and robust font.
