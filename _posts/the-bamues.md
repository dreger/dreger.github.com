title: The Bamues

Why hello dear Friend  
I've got a story for you  
A tale of priorities  
And I promise it's true.  

We start in Bamash  
Where Bamues call home  
T'was a simple town  
And the world was calm.  

Bamues went to work  
Then would get off at five  
They'd pick up their families  
And go out for a drive.  

They'd park in a park  
And play games in the sun  
Chasing Bunglebees and Slurps  
Oh what fun, fun, fun!  

Then one day the oPhone  
Showed up in our stores  
Look at all the oApps!  
Could you ever want more!  
  
Soon all Bamue girls  
And all Bamue chaps  
Were holding an oPhone  
And playing their oApps  

They stare at those screens  
As they walk around town  
Ignoring everything else  
All heads tilted down  

They still talked to each other  
But not in the usual way  
They tap updates to oChirp   
And oMessage all day  

But now parks are empty  
The sun sits there alone  
For Bamues are inside  
All playing with oPhones  

But one day a traveler  
Came to Bamash  
A well dressed young man  
Though he had little cash  

And this well dressed young chap  
Strolled straight into town  
But his hands were empty   
His head wasn't down!  

He walked up to a Bamue   
"Hello, good sir" he said  
"Are there hotels around  
That I might rest my head?"  

But the Bamue man just stared  
Then said with a huff  
"Stop bothering me  
there's an oApp for that stuff."  

The young chap took a breath  
"I'm sorry," he said  
The Bamue man went off  
oPhone back to his head.  

Our visitor just stood there,   
As Bamues walked around  
Not a word being said  
And all eyes towards the ground  

"These Bamues miss the point,"  
Our young chap thought.  
"Perhaps I can show them,  
just how much they've lost."  

He spoke with each Bamue  
And tried to point at the sun  
To remind them of nature  
To remind them of fun  

But the response was the same  
Whether Bamue sister or father  
Their minds on the oPhones  
And didn't want to be bothered  

Despair filled the heart  
Of our well dressed young man  
With no cash in his pockets  
And two empty hands  

He packed up his things   
Though they were few  
And headed out of Bamash  
Leaving the Bamues  

Outside of the town  
He paused to straighten his tie  
When he saw something glitter  
From the corner of his eye  

That's when he saw it  
A tower quite tall  
That powered the oPhones  
oApps, it all!  

The young chap then knew  
What had to be done  
He'd unplug the tower   
And bring back true fun.  

He rushed to the base   
Of the mighty tall structure  
"Now where is the plug,"   
He silently wondered.   

He searched and he searched  
He looked all around  
When finally he spotted  
Some wire on the ground.  

But try as he might  
To pull out the cord  
The ground held firm  
And he soon became sore.  

As he lay on his back  
A Bamue walked by    
A pretty Bamue girl   
With piecing blue eyes  

"What are you doing,"  
she asked the young man  
And he noticed she too,   
Had two empty hands.   

"I'm trying to unplug this tower,"   
The young chap sighed  
"The Bamues are Bamboozled  
Life's passing them by!"  

The Bamue girl stood there   
Then said with a smirk  
"Perhaps if I help,  
There will be less work."  

So together they stood  
And held firm to the plug  
Then pulled as hard  
As their arms could tug.  

And then with a POP!  
The wire did snap,  
And our two strange friends  
Ran back to Bamash.  

Back in the town  
The Bamues stood confused  
Their oPhones stopped working  
No oChirps, no oTunes!  

With screens now off,  
They looked up from their shoes  
And each met the gaze  
Of another Bamue  

Our two friends arrived back  
in the town with a bus.   
And each Bamash citizen   
Got aboard without fuss.   

They arrived at the park  
In just a half hour  
And Bamues filled off  
With their eyes full of wonder.  

Our young couple watched  
As Bamues broke out in games  
Chassing Bunglebees and Slurps  
Just like the old days.   

The young chap and Bamue girl  
Walked off into the sun  
Their work here was finished  
They'd brought back the fun  

And every Bamue   
Learned a lesson that day  
If you stare at a screen  
You life slips away.  

So best you turn off   
Your oPhone, or whatever  
Because I promise you real life  
Is oh so much better.
