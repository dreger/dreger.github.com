title: One year
---

It's been one year since I started dating my girlfriend. She is my best friend, someone I confide in all the time and my spiritual support. I'll never forget the day she invited me to coffee, our first date, and how I made sure to ask her back "same time, same place" the next day. 

I could not have asked God for a better partner and I thank Him for her every day. I ask that He look over us as we embark on another year together and that we remember that nothing is too big for Him to handle. I cannot wait to keep growing with her. 

Love you, sweetheart.
