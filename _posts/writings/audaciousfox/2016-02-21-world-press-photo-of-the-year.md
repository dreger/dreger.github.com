Out of 82,951 photos, from 5,775 photographers, an image from Australian photographer Warren Richardson [has been selected as World Press Photo of the Year][richardson]. His photo, taken at the Hungarian-Serbian border, depicts a man helping pass a baby underneath the border's razor wire fence. World Press Photo: 

> Richardson is a freelance photographer, currently based in Budapest, Hungary. He explained how the picture was made:
> 
>  > [...] They sent women and children, then fathers and elderly men first. I must have been with this crew for about five hours and we played cat and mouse with the police the whole night. I was exhausted by the time I took the picture. It was around three o’clock in the morning and you can’t use a flash while the police are trying to find these people, because I would just give them away. So I had to use the moonlight alone.

This is such a haunting image. Be sure to check out the [gallery of other winners][gallery], and scroll down beneath each photo to see the GPS, camera, and technical details of the shot.
