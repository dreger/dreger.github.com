This may be a terrible, terrible idea, but I want to try it: talking through my RSS feeds live.

I state this in the episode, but I'll say it again here: this might end up being a terrible format for listeners. If that ends up being the case, I'll either a.) change the show's format, or b.) go back to written summaries of the day's news. But I have to try, and I love working with audio.

This first episode is a little rough, but I think that things got better around minute seven, when you can hear me relax a little. As I do a few more episodes, I'll get more comfortable in front of the microphone, and things should sound more natural and conversational. If you listened to all or part of the episode, I'd love your feedback: [@dreger](http://twitter.com/dreger).
