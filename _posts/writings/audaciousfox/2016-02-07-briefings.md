In 2004, John Gruber [introduced the Daring Fireball Linked List][dfll]: 

> New feature at Daring Fireball: the [Linked List](http://daringfireball.net/linked/), a daily list of interesting links and brief commentary on DF-related topics, updated frequently but not frenetically. 

Daring Fireball has the Linked List. Coudal has Fresh Signals. Everyone has some form of _shit I want to link to and comment on_. 

Audacious Fox will have Briefings. Aside from the name, Briefings will differ from the typical Linked List style in a few ways. 

One of the biggest differences between Briefings and the linked list style that everyone else follows is that Briefings will not hijack the title of that Briefing as a link to the source material. 

This solves two issues I have with most linked-to content: 

1. The author has to include some additional icon that serves as the permalink to their commentary.
2. Because the headline is also the link to the source material, authors can get lazy and avoid writing any form of lede or introductory. This most often looks like this: 


Also, outside of the tech pundit world, there's no convention for title-of-post-is-actually-an-external-link. Following this niche convention generally confused the non-techs who I'm writing for. 

The format Briefings will use is more usable, forces me to write better introductions, and lets me not worry about choosing just one link to point to.
