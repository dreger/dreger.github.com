I've been looking forward to this game for two years, and it's almost here. I'll be covering the reviews that get released today, but I'll omit anything from _my commentary or the pull-quotes_ that might spoil unreleased details about the game. 

For the unaware, _Firewatch_ is the first game from [Panic]-backed game studio, [Campo Santo]. Aside from the art style, which looks incredible, I'm most excited to work my way through the story. From the [Steam game page][steam]: 

> The year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor Delilah is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—your only contact with the world you've left behind. But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the forest, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have. 
  

If you're curious, I'll be buying my copy for PS4. If you plan on buying the game on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you can still take advantage of a 10% discount by [pre-ordering the game on Steam][steam]. 

**Update:** Looks like PS4 users can get a 10% discount by purchasing _Firewatch_ on release day. You are officially out of reasons to not buy this game.

**Notes on spoilers:** _Although my comments and pull-quotes below are spolier-free, the Guardian's review reveals a number of plot details for Firewatch. If you want to go into the game completely fresh, save the full piece for later this week._

The Guardian's Nathan Ditum, [in his review][guardian] of _Firewatch_: 


> The writing is not just believable, it is likeable and funny. Henry and Delilah’s exchanges are full of the familiar tug and tarry of people getting to know each other, of playing and of flirting, and of reaching out to feel less alone. Henry’s sadsack dryness – by turns curt, dopey and earnest – isn’t just endearing, it’s endearingly realistic. His words sound like something we might say, which makes the dialogue choices the game offers all the more effective. It’s a matter of investment, even if we’re not deciding anything crucial, we buy it. We’re in.

Colin Campbell, [reporting for Polygon][polygon]: 

> Delilah and Henry represent an emerging trend in games, of paired characters who are individually and collectively simpatico but who struggle with their own anxieties and with one another's perceived shortcomings. Their relationship has form and shape, though it shimmers and shifts as the story progresses.

> These two characters are written with a conviction and authenticity rarely seen in video games. Neither of them is idealized, not even for a second. Their self-doubts and flaws are carved into the script and into the optional responses. Their ordinariness is what makes them so appealing.

The echoing refrain I've heard about _Firewatch_ is that it's very well written, and the voice acting is just great.

Last one for the night. Hayden Dingman, [covering the game for PCWorld][pcworld]: 

> _Firewatch_ is beautiful. _Firewatch_ is intriguing. But ultimately I don't think _Firewatch_ is very good. At its best, this is a quiet game about two characters struggling with real-life insecurities. But when that's sidelined to make room for a main plot, _Firewatch_ suffers. It's a game perfect for trailers, a game full of excellent dialogue and breathtaking moments and stunning vistas that ultimately amounts to nothing much at all.

Both [Metacritic] and [OpenCritic], sites that aggregate reviews, peg _Firewatch_ at 82/100. I don't expect _Firewatch_ to set the world on fire, but I feel it's going to be one of those games that raises the bar. Knockout graphics, great voice acting. Expect to hear about this one for the next couple of weeks.
