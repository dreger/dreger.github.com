Facebook:
> Giving people the power to share and connect requires constant innovation. At Facebook, we solve technical problems no one else has seen because no one else has built a social network of this size.

>

> Working at the intersection of research and engineering to make the world more open and connected is one of the best things about being at Facebook right now.

They've got some really interesting research papers compiled. I particularly liked "[Feed Me: motivating newcomer contribution in social network sites](https://www.facebook.com/publications/374594649278664)" from 2009 &mdash; if only for the nostalgic screenshots of old Facebook designs.
