Tapbots answers some questions, and hint at some upcoming features, for Tweetbot 3. Noteworthy tidbits:

- Text size is tied to iOS 7's dynamic font size in Settings.app > General > Text Size.
- A night theme is coming(!).
- Tweetbot 2 will eventually return to the App Store, but you can re-download it if you've previously purchased a copy in App Store.app > Purchased.
- Tweetbot for OS X will be getting an update to bring Mavericks compatibility in the coming weeks.
