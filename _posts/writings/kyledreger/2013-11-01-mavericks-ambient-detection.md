Neat feature of Mavericks that prevents the machine from going to sleep if it detects a change in ambient lighting, regardless of the current idle time.

Reminds me of how Macbook LEDs would, while asleep, [pulse at the rate of a resting-adult's respiratory rhythm](http://www.google.com/patents/US6658577). Delight is in the details.
