Hello, again. Craig Mod, in a [beautifully-written piece](https://medium.com/message/lets-talk-about-margins-14646574c385):

> Reach for a book. The dedication and earnestness of those who made it is revealed immediately in the margins. If the margins feel questionable, be suspicious. Other corners were likely cut. All authors should have a Margin Clause in their contracts. Objection, your honor. Never be fooled by a fancy cover. Always remember: Covers are just there to protect pages with beautiful margins.

I've worked with design for a decade; however, the most challenging work I've ever done was designing a small book for print, back in a class I had in college.
