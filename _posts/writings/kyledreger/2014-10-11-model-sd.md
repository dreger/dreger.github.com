No shifting of gears, just pure acceleration. Listen to the audio in the video; it sounds like a rocket ship. A $120 thousand rocket ship, anyhow. 

I would love to own an electric vehicle one day; I think they're the future of transportation for this world. And once we increase efficiency, or drastically reduce the cost, of solar technology, then things get really interesting. 

If you're interested in electric vehicles, be sure to check out what the [motorcycles are doing](http://www.zeromotorcycles.com) in this space.
