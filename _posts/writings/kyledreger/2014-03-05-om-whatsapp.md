Om Malik, the founder of Gigaom, put together some truly awesome charts that help [illustrate, and give context to, the meteoric rise of WhatsApp](http://om.co/2014/03/03/whatsapp-vs-facebook/):

> These charts show that not only WhatsApp is different, but it is exceptional and did well to capture the moment (i.e., rise of the mobile broadband) near perfectly. They are also not just exceptional, they are a standout with highest rate of growth and getting to that point the fastest.

As Roman philosopher Seneca would say, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
