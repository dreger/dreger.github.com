## Hello, There

Hi, I'm Kyle. Welcome to my blog, grab a cup of coffee and stay a while. 

I am 19 years old and live in Alliance, Ohio, where I am  attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu) for computer science and English writing. 

I love to code. There's something about the syntax, rules and grammar that give me a sense of peace and order. When I finish writing the logic, it's time to design. I spend hours creating, tweaking and aligning every single pixel to be perfect. There are hundreds of different blues, reds and greens; it's finding the perfect one that matters. Back in the real world, I play soccer and have the most beautiful girlfriend in the world.

## This site

Whenever I’ve been kicking something around in my head, I sit down and write about it. Main topics are faith, technology and living with less. I also write for the University's blog, of which all my posts can be found [here](http://blog.mountunion.edu/blog/author/dregerkq/). 

## Setup


This site is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) for static page generation. This because it gives me complete control over the code, and design, of my site. The domain was purchased through [Hover](http://hover.com). 

I draft and edit my posts in [iA Writer for Mac](http://www.iawriter.com/) with some background music in iTunes. I love my 13′ Macbook Pro and Verizon iPhone 4.

My life goal is to help people. I hope what I write here helps you, in at least so far as giving you something interesting to read.

## Contact

If you wish to comment on a post, or contact me, [shoot me an email](mailto:hi@kyledreger.com?subject=hello!) and I'll get back to you within a day or two. I'm also available on Twitter [@kyledreger](http://twitter.com/kyledreger). For the cool nerds, go ahead and open up an issue at [kyledreger/feedback](https://github.com/kyledreger/feedback/issues/new) on GitHub.
