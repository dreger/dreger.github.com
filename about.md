## Hello

This is the humble weblog of Kyle Dreger. You can find his [tweets](http://twitter.com/dreger), [code](http://github.com/dreger) and [links](http://pinboard.in/u:kyledreger) elsewhere on the web. 

If you fancy to comment on a post, or contact Kyle, email <hi@kyledreger.com> and he'll get back to you within a day or two. The cool nerds can also open up an issue at [dreger/feedback](https://github.com/kyledreger/feedback/issues/new) on GitHub.

## Est. 2010

This blog was born in the fall of 2010, when Kyle began attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu). 

He loves clean, honest design, Apple things, writing out ideas and playing soccer. He also has the most beautiful girlfriend in the world. 

## Setup

Using a combination of [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), Kyle is able to generate a lightweight, static blog - which rocks harder than any CMS. The kyledreger.com domain was originally purchased through GoDaddy, but later moved to [Hover](http://hover.com). You may occasionally see custom typefaces here, and those are served by the lovely [Typekit](http://typekit.com). 

All writing is done via a combination of Notation Velocity, and [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/). Each post is written with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) formatting, and lives in it's own text file; making this entire blog extremely portable, and simple. The writing takes place on either a 13' Macbook Pro, or an iPhone 4.

If you had to describe Kyle in one sentence, it might look like this: a passionate individual who lives to help people. Hopefully you found something here to enjoy, thanks for reading.
