## Hello, there

Every website needs a good "about" page. He's my shot at it: 

Kyle Dreger is 19 years old and is currently in Alliance, Ohio, attending the [University of Mount Union](http://mountunion.edu) for computer science and English writing. Interesting combination? He thinks so. He loves to code and design. He passionately spends hours creating, tweaking and aligning every single pixel to be perfect. Back in the real world, he plays soccer and has the most beautiful girlfriend in the world.

## This site

This site is a place for Kyle to document his journey through the computer science major and college. Main topics include faith, technology, gadgets and living with less. He also writes for his purple university's blog, of which all my posts can be found [here](http://blog.mountunion.edu/blog/author/dregerkq/). 

## Setup

This site is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) for static page generation. The domain was originally purchased through GoDaddy, but later moved to the much more ethical registrar, [Hover](http://hover.com). The lovely Adelle Web font is served by [Typekit](http://typekit.com). 

Drafts and edits are done in [iA Writer for Mac](http://www.iawriter.com/) with some background music from iTunes. Kyle owns a lovely 13â€² Macbook Pro and Verizon iPhone 4.

If you had to describe Kyle in one sentence, it might look like this: a passionate individual who's life goal is to help people. He hopes what is written here helps you, in at least so far as giving you something interesting to read.
